I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I had studied for hours, even days non-stop for the sake of one test. Normally, studying for that long would almost guarantee a perfect grade.

Even then, even with all that time I wasted, I still only managed to get about a 50. I started shaking in fear at what just happened, even though it had happened an incomprehensible number of times now in a multitude of formats. Atychiphobia was already a hellhole before this whole powers thing came into play.

"Again?" My classmate sitting next to me peered over at my test and let out a quiet giggle. I felt the insatiable urge to punch him, but I didn't bother to try. After all, I'd fail anyway, and that causes problems in more ways than one. So, instead of using my fists, I walked away without a word to speak or punches to throw.

Maybe, I should just confine myself to my bed. Nothing bad can happen then, right?

As these sorts of thoughts cross my head, I suddenly slip on a pebble and come crashing to the floor.

Never mind, then. Maybe I should just confine myself to this floor instead. That way, I don't have to get up and fall again.

*Why must my mind be so peculiar?*

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
