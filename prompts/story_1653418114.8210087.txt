STORY:
================================

*"I have a story for you Reporter. One I've never told a human soul before; I take no part in who goes to hell."*

*"Then who does?"*

*"You humans. You send yourselves down, driven by your own guilt. Forcing yourselves to relive your sins over and over...The best part? The doors are unlocked. You can leave at any time. It says something when no one ever does, doesn't it?"* ([Lucifer, Season 3 Episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmGthplAUM))

&amp;#x200B;

"Huh." I said, looking around the place. Is this Hell? It looks like an endless apartment complex. Y'know, the ones that span out for miles? The weird part is that ALL of the doors are unlocked...every single one. Then there's the people just walking into them, with no life whatsoever in their actions or eyes. Then the screaming, crying, the "Please stop! I promise I won't do it again!" "No, my actions were right!" "Help!" "I'm Sorry!". I passed by one and there was a "Whip me HARDER!". 

"Yup. This is hell...and a BDSM lover's dream it seems." Then there was the person sitting in the corner. Looked quite sad, yes. So, I sat down next to him.

"Strange. A human who doesn't go off to get tortured." He began, confused as to why I didn't join the rest.

"I see no point. I committed my share of sins, yes but no need to be reminded of it for eternity." Which was my honest belief, thanks to a Preacher at a church I went to during my youth. 

"For a human, your beliefs are rather odd. They don't align with what Father believes."

"Thanks? But then again, I don't regret my death. Kinda hard to do so when your city is missiled by some myopic asshole with the world's smallest handicap and you're at fallout zone. I highly doubt there's anything of me to even bury." Yup. I died due to some foppish prick (did he have orange hair? I don't remember) that decided to shoot a missile at a city. Though he could get away with it too. Ha hah, **NOPE**.

"You got any earplugs?" I asked my new friend, who looked at me confused. "I wanna take a walk but don't wanna hear any of this."

"Let me introduce you to some of my brothers and sisters. I get the feeling they would like you." He said, getting up and offering me a hand. They say that death is the next adventure, right? Well, I guess making friends with the Fallen populace would qualify as an adventure.... right?
