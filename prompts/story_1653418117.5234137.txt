STORY:
================================

"Man It can't be hard..." said Errod Dankowski, as he went upstairs for another cup of coffee.

"I just checked their site, and these problems look typical, just with a bunch of extra symbols reserved for someone with a degree."

At this point the coffee filter was empty. He knew it would be easy to solve the P=NP problem by simply refilling it.

If a filter needed N points, and a coffee ground cannister had N points, then there would be N points to refill it. Take from the cannister, and the filter was receiving from something that existed outside itself.

"Well that was easy." he thought, having solved the problem in about 30 minutes, plus a few hours turning it into a program.

"All I had to do was draw from infinity."

He wrote a letter, and signed it 'E'. It would take the university years to learn about his discovery.
