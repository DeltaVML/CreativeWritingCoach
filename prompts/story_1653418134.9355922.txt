I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I could see it, Medusa was a thirsty one. Medusa was a priestess of Athena cursed, by Athena, for wanting to dance the horizontal mambo with her (brother/cousin/uncle/something horrible like that) so bad she broke her vow of celibacy, so i think that checks out. If she finally found someone she wouldnt turn to stone i think shed be gettin attached, literally and figuratively, real quick. Seeing as getting some was worth risking the anger of god.

 Who knows, maybe Artemis passes by, lets out a big ol YAS, and fixes em up for each other. New eyes for one and new hair/legs for the other! That'd be beautiful.



 Though tbh this is Greek mythology, everyone is either gonna die, turn into a monster, or bang their mother; and somebody, somewhere, is gonna get porked by Zeus.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
