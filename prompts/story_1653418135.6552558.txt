STORY:
================================

Huh.

That is all I could think of at that moment. It was him, clear as day. Zeke; a friend I made during the war. The *Civil* War. I mean I thought him dead - we got split up during an ambush and I was the only one to report in after I survived, so there wasn't much room for interpretation yet...

"Surprised?" he suddenly said.

"You could say that," I replied with a bit of suspicion and hung my coat on the wall. "Tea?" I asked.

"2 sugars and milk, if you would," he smiled. I walked over to the kitchen to put the kettle on.

"So," I started as I poured filled the kettle with water, "immortal, huh?"

"Thought you were the only one?"

"Not necessarily," I said and flicked the stove on, "but during this entire time, I never found anyone else. Just didn't expect it."

"How long is that, mind you?"

I chuckled and racked my brain for the exact time.

"Let's just say I used to go by 'Cassianus' at one point."

"You went from Cassianus to Casey? Really?" he laughed. "A little on the nose, don't you think?"

"Well," I smiled, "I was used to it."

"I'm only 179. You know the ambush when we were going to Vicksburg?"

"Last time I saw you," I remarked somberly.

"First time I died," he commented casually. Silence gripped the room for a while, suddenly interrupted by the wheezing of the kettle. I stood up and poured two cups of tea, handing one to my friend.

"It was a bit of a... surprise, to say the least," he continued.

"I can imagine. Look, Zeke, I'm glad you're okay, if surprised, but I must-"

"You want to know why I'm here now, after all this time?" he interrupted. I nodded.

"I think I found a way," he said.

"A way for what?"

"For us to die."

Once again, silence gripped the room. I gave him a long look. This time, he decided to break the silence.

"Don't tell me you don't want to."

I opened my mouth lightly but failed to find the right words. I've searched for a way to die for so long, but... I gave up centuries ago. Since then I've simply made my peace and didn't look back. For it to now come back so abruptly, I didn't have the time to consider it.

"And you're here why?" I asked, trying to redirect the conversation. "To offer me death?"

"I need your help."

"Look, Zeke, I... I am content with the way things are. I make new friends. Then I say my goodbyes. It's just the way it is. You think *I* didn't look for a way? There is none. It's a wild goose chase that consumes you and takes whatever enjoyment you can find in this life."

He sighed. "I'm not giving up. I'm stronger than that. And you will help me." With those words, he finished his tea and stood up.

"Zeke, please. This is a doomed cause. We can-"

"You have the experience and means to help me in the search and you will do so."

"I'm sorry," I said with notable sorrow. "I won't enable you. It will consume-"

"You will help me or-"

"Or what?" I barked back. "Kill me?"

"No," he said with a grim smile, "not you."

I realized what he meant. This entire time, the entire generations I saw die and yet I could never stop caring. And he knows that. I calmly put down my tea - I've been alive far too long to get nervous.

"Alright Zeke. Alright. But know this," I said, standing up to get my coat. I opened the door and looked back at him.

"It won't end well for you."
