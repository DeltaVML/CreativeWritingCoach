STORY:

"Don't know. Sorry dude."

I stared at the words in confusion. Don't know? *Don't know?!?*

This had to be a prank. Surely I had a power, just like everyone else. There had been cases before when powers didn't manifest until a few years later, but they always came, eventually. And the letter *always* told you exactly what it was. Even for something as obscure as telekinesis that only works on cheese.

Luckily, there was a system in place for unclear descriptions. I filled in the form, and soon they set up an appointment with the seeress who wrote my description. Standard stuff. 

As I walked into the room, I heard the blaring hiphop from the speaker on her desk. Then I saw the seeress herself. She was covered in tattoos and piercings, wearing a definitely not office-appropriate outfit, and resting her feet on the desk.

"Hey. Figured you would come see me eventually.", she said. 

"Um... why are you..." I sputtered out, staring at her.

"Oh, this? Because I like it, and they can't afford to fire me for it. I'm literally one in a million. They need me."

That... actually made a lot of sense. Seeresses were rare, and in high demand. 

"So... what exactly is my power?"

"Right... your power..." she said, as she was starting to look a bit uncomfortable. "Umm... is it okay if I tell you about mine first?"

I nodded. Was she trying to change the subject? Was I powerless after all?

"Well, I'm a seeress," she said, "which means I can see the future. Specifically, I can see the future of someone's abilities. They show me pictures of 13-year-old kids, and I see images of them... doing things. Using their powers. I get ideas, too. Once I see enough to figure out exactly what their power is, I write the description and they send it off to them on their 14th birthday."

"So why did mine say 'don't know, sorry dude'?"

"Because I don't know what your power is. It's weird for me too."

"Could it be... that I'm powerless?"

"No. Definitely not. You can do *something*. I just can't figure out what."

"Did you actually *see* future me do anything?"

"That's the weird part. I saw everything and nothing. I saw you both fail and succeed at using every single power I've ever seen, and several others I haven't. You have all powers, and you have no powers. It doesn't make any sense."

"So what you're saying is I could either be powerless or more powerful than anyone else?"

I felt like a weight had lifted off my body. I had powers. A lot of them. I just had to figure out how they worked.

"No, it has to be both somehow. Dude... you're floating."

I suddenly snapped back to reality. It was true. I was floating near the ceiling. Since when was I able to levitate?

Just as I thought that, I fell down again. Apparently I couldn't levitate, after all. Or there was some strange rule about it that I didn't know. 

"Ow! That hurt!", I exclaimed upon hitting the ground. I was bleeding all over the place. But then I felt my wounds closing up.

"You have healing powers too?", the seeress said in disbelief. "Damn, dude, I've never seen someone with multiple powers before."

Just as my last wound was about to close up, it stopped. I was still bleeding, but only from one small wound. 

Actually, was I bleeding? It almost seemed like it was going backwards, sucking the blood back in from the floor. Weird. 

"Dude. Come with me. We *have* to figure out how you work. We could rule the world!"

"What about your job?"

"Screw my job! I will never get a chance like this again! Let's go!"
