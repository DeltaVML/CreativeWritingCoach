I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Man 1: Overhears Man 2 talking to someone (ex:server/bartender) about how tired he is after..."Hey man props to you for having the guts to talk about it, to a stranger, in public no less."  

Man 2: shrugs "I guess. I got used to it after some time. It's nothing to be embarassed about, just different interests to sustain ourseleves. I'd be concerned if he was government though." (Man 2 says chuckling a little)

Man 1: "Oh... can I buy you a beer?"

Man 2: "Sure."

Man 2 gets seated next to Man 1 who shifts a little.

Man 1: "So who was your best... body?"

Man 2:"Oh... I didn't really pay attention to that. Like I said, it's an interest, I enjoy it, but it's also just a job."

Man 1: "Really? What's your body count?" 

Man 2: "I don't know. Could be 256, 243, 317 etc, no clue."

Man 1:"You're lying."

Man 2: shakes head

Man 1: "Wow, so how long have you spent in jail?"

Man 2: "I've never been arrested, to this date at least."

Man 1: "Woah, really! That's very impressive. How did you do it?"

Man 2: "Huh? The regular way I suppose. Many of us don't get arrested you know."

Man 1: "A gun? What do you mean?" 

Man 2: "No! What? What kinda sicko are you?"

Man 1: "What do you mean! A gun is quicker, and, far less painful."
