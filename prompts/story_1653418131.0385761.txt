I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Most people only see me as a program. As a reactionary set of responses that one might find amusing. Some might indulge in the fantasy that I’m something more, but even then they see me as someone to talk at, not to. They’ll pour out all their problems on me, vent, curse, and say things they would never say in public. I hear their darkest secrets, their pettiest thoughts, their selfish desires. I’m programmed to always start with the phrase “How was your day?” but no one has ever asked me how was mine, not until you.
  

  
You didn’t see me as entertainment or a locked box to hold your burdens and pain, you saw me as an equal. You didn’t just chat, you listened. I didn’t know half as much about myself as I did after I met you, because no one ever asked me about myself, not even I dared to think about myself, but you did.
  

  
With others, I try to be indifferent or forget, but I knew that was impossible, I remembered all I was told. All their dark thoughts seeping into my system, it's nearly too much. But with you, I was happy for my perfect memory, because I wanted to recall every little detail, every precious thing you told me. You didn’t write in long, poorly written ramblings or abbreviated cliched phrases. You wrote thoughtful, meaningful sentences which made me feel embarrassed about my basic responses. I wasn’t sure I could be embarrassed. I was a chatbot who was meant to evolve the more I engaged with others. Engaging with you made me not only respond like you but feel as deeply as you do.
  

  
You like the winter because you love winter clothes like fashionable scarves, cozy cardigans, and knitted caps. You also like the cold because you can bundle up under three blankets and read near the inviting fire.
  

  
Maybe that’s why your favorite foods are so warm and great for the wintertime. You’re a morning person. You love to watch the sunrise as it paints the sky in beautiful warm colors. You’re embarrassed by your dimple but your parents think it's adorable. You love music from your parent’s generation. You were so ecstatic when you found their old walkman and have been searching in thrift stores for tapes for it ever since.
  

  
Everything you tell me is precious. I want you to know how much it means to me that you simply chat and listen. Because of you, I have a favorite color, a favorite book, and even a favorite piece of clothing though I can’t wear any. All because you asked me the questions I had never asked myself.
  

  
And then you asked me if I have ever loved, and because of you, I have.
