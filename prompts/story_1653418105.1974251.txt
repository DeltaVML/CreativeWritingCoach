STORY:
================================

“It’s inefficient and slow.” The insufferable little man complained for the third time in 2 standard intervals. 

“The Lyrnaure way represents true travel beyond light speed.” Uhigiria made the message flash on the humans small display screen tied to the small man’s wrist. It was not a bad way of communicating with the frustrating humans who seemed incapable of learning any of the 17 standard galactic languages. “It already breaks your species understanding of the physical universe.” 

“Oh sure you rock it on the straightaways but your turn like a supermarket trolley and your pit stops are more go kart than Formula 1.” The man complained to the screen on his arm. That was the downside of the display screens, humans tended to look at them while talking instead of who they were actually talking to. Uhigiria reached out with a body hand and grabbed the human by its head tilting its face up to look at him.

“Suggestions are asked of you, not meaningless complaints.” The words appeared on the screen in the corner of the human’s eye as he looked up at the pale 4 eyed face of his supervisor. 

“Alright, we should drift between the Lyrnaure way gates.” The human said firmly.

“How would turning our engines off increase efficiency?” Uhigiria asked, as mad as it sounded there might be a chance to save fuel rattling around in this human’s brain.

“No not like that.” The human explained brushing Uhigiria’s hand aside and hopping up on a stool next to the display screen. “Alright so the gate travel is awesome, post light speed and all that, but its only straight lines, so you have all these turns and intersections where gates going in different directions meet up. We always spend like half a week at those damn things slowing down to just a few hundred kilometres per second, re aligning with the next gate and then going through. We could have been halfway to our destination in that time.”

“The time spent between gates can indeed be long.” Uhigiria conceded as he watched the human drawing lines and shapes he presumed was meant to represent one such intersection of Lyrnaure ways. “It is required for safe exit and re-entry of the Lyrnaure ways.” 

“No it’s not.” The human claimed, once again speaking to his wrist screen. “I’ve done the math, if we angle the ship while in the Lyrnaure way and we turn off the inertia dampeners for just a fraction of a second at around 0,24 seconds before we hit the exit then we could carry out a good 3% of the speed from the Lyrnaure way. That means we could be going like 100,000 kilometres per second as we exit. Now if we’ve angle ourselves right we can blast afterburners like there’s no tomorrow and ride that speedboost all the way to the next gate and hit it at the perfect angle to sail straight through and complete the crossing in minutes rather days.”

Uhigiria watched the little man ramble excited about his plan. It had been wrong to hope for a way to save fuel, humans had never been able to differentiate efficient and fast. “The idea is ludicrous. The strain on the ship for moving at those speeds outside the Lyrnaure ways would be-“

“Well within safety limits, I’ve already done the math.” The man said and slapping what looked suspiciously like a drawn on napkin onto the screen, Uhigiria decided not to find out what made it stick. He leaned in and studied the numbers.

“Have you run them by the computer?” He asked as he looked at the meaningless scribbles, he had never been gifted in numbers, but he wasn’t about to let a human know that.

“Yeah, it all checks out within safety limits.” He smiled as he hopped down from his stool with a bump that hid a muttered “Theoretically.” 

“Alright human, I suppose it is worthy of an attempt.” Uhigiria admitted, spending less time between Lyrnaure ways would greatly enhance their ability to react to changes. “But what about the risk of other ships being at the intersections?”

“Oh I’ve got a solution for that, we can set up a stationary radiation emitter at each one that emits electromagnetic waves through the Lyrnaure ways to let people know it’s their turn to go. It would travel at the speed of light, hit the gate to get ramped up in speed and reach the other end in time to tell whoever wants to enter if the coast is clear.”

“Radiation emitters can be harmful. We will have to choose the frequency carefully.” Uhigiria noted carefully.

“I suggest we pick Red light and Green light.” The human said proudly and shrugged when asked to elaborate on why. “Just makes it feel like home.”
