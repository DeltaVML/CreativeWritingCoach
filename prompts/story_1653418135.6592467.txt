I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Cleo sighed, looking at the roof of the elevator as it makes its ascent. The thought of Laura boarding the plane to Italy, her eyes bright and hopeful as she waves, brings a tear to Cleo's eyes.

It's always bittersweet seeing friends leave for a better tomorrow when you somehow know you'll never see them again. A pang is felt in the depths of her still chest. The elevator dings.

The doors open, and Cleo wipes away a tear she hadn't realised had fallen down her face. 'This never gets easier - I always think it'll be easier this time' she thinks to herself. Going through the motions of walking down the hallway, and unlocking her apartment door. 

She sets her keys down in their waiting dish, slips of her shoes, and makes her way to the kitchen; the transition from the soft carpet to the cold, hard tiles sends a momentary shock up her legs. With a stabilising breath, a habit she still hasn't managed to break after all these years, she opens her refrigerator. Her eyes search hungrily for that last bottle of A+ that she had been looking forward to all day, and she finds its... Not there.

She barely has time to formulate the thought 'this is wrong' when she hears a voice call out 'you're losing your touch' from the loungeroom. That voice. She would know that voice anywhere. Caroline.
This is going to be a long night.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
