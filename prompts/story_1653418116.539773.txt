I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Sizzling, greasy oil oozed from the boy’s pimples, the congealed puss slobbering onto his face. A trail of snot ran down his nose, hanging and swinging as it slid across his chin and lips, covering them in slimy mucus. It bobbed up and down as he moved, impossible for onlookers to ignore yet he seemed to ignore it, every once in a while trying to suck it back up into his mouth with a churning slurping sound.

In his hand was a sticky lollipop, strands of hair both human and animal, and tufts of fabric stuck to it. Its red coloring made it look more like an open head wound where one had to sift through the hair to get a good look at the crispy dirtied hemoglobin. The boy then stuck it in his mouth.

The boy made his way through the disquieting woods. The ground was moist and tender, each step felt like walking on a gigantic tongue marinating in spit and the remnants of unchewed lunch. Each step caused moisture to fizzle and gurgle, squishing up soggy water that smelled like wet dog and mildew towels. The sound was almost like the giant tongue was salivating, the forest’s predatory, hungry gaze savoring the thought of swallowing him up with a dry, throaty gulp.

The boy smiled as he finally reached a small dog house. His smile was crooked and jagged with teeth crossing and folded over one another that might make a dentist consider tearing them out leaving the child with bleeding gums rather than fixing them with braces, shrugging at the lost cause.

He took out old moldy bread from his pocket where it had been mixing and mingling with smelly brass keys, melted chocolate goops, and muddy marbles, holding them out in front of the little hovel. A harsh ruff sounded from within, the sound like a sickly person gagging on their own mucus as they try to dispel it from their desiccated lungs.

The sound belonged to a mangy wolf with a blind, glassy eye, spouts of tangled hairballs stuck to their otherwise wrinkly pink hairless skin which was the same texture as an old rooster’s flabby neck. Its tongue lolled out of its mouth, dry as sandpaper and hanging like a dead limb, flailing uselessly.

It scarfed down the bread, which was fuzzy and discolored from the mold, crumbs sticking in its teeth which seemed more like garnered tree knots than calcium fangs. The wolf smiled feverishly at the malnourished offering, licking the boy’s sweaty face with its tendril-like tongue causing the boy to break into laughter which echoed through the forest like a woman’s last scream before her dying breath.

The boy embraced the wolf with stubby, muddy arms, nuzzling his slimy cheeks with the wolf’s jagged ones. The boy smiled a secret smile one might see on immature fops who had just watched an elderly person trip. The boy pulled out a small green ball the color of mold and mucus which caused the wolf’s eye to light up like a burning hospital. He grinned his discomforting grin before hurling the ball which the wolf eagerly pursued and returned to him. The two continued their back and forth even as the night grew ever more dark and disquieting.
