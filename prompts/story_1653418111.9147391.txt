STORY:
================================

"And in breaking news our newest member of the hero society awakened his powers during the rescue of a kitten announced a member of a newscast, apparently our hero was incidentally also trapped in the burning abyss and that is when his powers kicked in. Our hero Tri...

"Great another member of our society has awakened his powers declared a middle aged man while clicking off the teleprompter with his remote, and here i am almost in my thirties without any super powers. Everyone in my family has obtained their super powers without having to lift as much as a finger and I  who has dedicated every waking minute super hero training, have yet to achieve anything above average. 

The young man stared at his sandwich which was not extraordinary but exceptional.

"Even this sandwich is nothing to write home about, thought the exceptional young man. 

He sat and wondered if he would ever get his powers in time to attend the super hero convention held once a year. 

Eureka! Maybe my super power is to be exceptional at everything I attempt announced the man, and that is why i have yet to accomplish any extraordinary feats. That has to be the reason. I knew God had a plan for me.

"The astounded man began to marvel at his entire apartment as if it was the first time he had been blessed with the sense of sight. He began to admire every detail the light in the room provided." 

"Everything seems average, concluded the man with an awe inspiring tone, my power has finally been revealed. It is hard to believe that the truth was sitting right in front of me the whole time. The blinds I put up last week serve as proof of my talent. They installed exceptionally well." 

The man's interest did not halt with the blinds. He inspected the whole house. Everything he had did himself was revised and graded according to function and design. He approved of all his past endeavors.

"Come to think of it, proceeded the man in thought, I have always been remarkably average at everything I have done. 

The man began to wonder at the endless possibilities now achievable with his newly discovered super power.

"I always wanted to go to the moon claimed the man, it is about time i gave it a shot. 

Just then he heard his phone ring and his door resonate sounds of beatings from the other side. 

"Just a minute, yelled the hero, Hello? 

"Hi we have been notified by our radar that a new hero has emerged in your vicinity. Have you or anyone in the residence discovered any sort of skills or talents that could be of use to the Interstellar federation?"

"Open the door Ted, demanded a feminine voice from the other side of the blockade, these groceries weigh a ton." If you do not open the door you can forget about dessert!"

"Sir we can hear there are other people present, scrambled the voice on the other end of the line, we can call at another time. But we must advise that if you are the person we seek it is of the up most importance that you keep your identity concealed. All of the known heros who were once fighting to keep the peace have been corrupted by the very people who awarded them their official titles. 

"Ted," cried the voice from the other side of the door. You know how much I hate it when you make me feel unimportant. Whatever you can cook your own dinner then!

Anyone who was present could hear a loud thud followed by a few footsteps that signified a two legged entity's departure.

"I have to go, admitted Ted, but i will return your call as soon as I can. I discovered my super power moments ago but I doubt that it could be of any use to the Interstellar Federation. 

Ted hung up the phone and raced out of the door hopping over a bag of toppled over groceries at the doorway. He sprinted past a couple, who were on their way to free themselves of the layers of clothing needed to navigate through the city while keeping themselves away from the grasps of hypothermia.

"Hey Ted, shes on her way towards the elevator declared the couple, you can still catch her if the elevator is not working. 

"Thanks guys and happy holidays, said ted as he rushed past them, I will ask Jenny to make her special Christmas. I will let you guys know how it goes.

He turned to face foward and saw a small women jabbing at the elevator buttons.

"Jenny, gasped Ted, please wait. I was on the phone with some very important people and...

"And what Ted, demanded the Jenny, don't tell me the interstellar federation finally called and are looking for you to help them on a mission to save the planet from its pending destruction. You know what Ted? Whenever you decide what is important in your life you can call me until then i will be at my sister's. Bye Ted.

"Hold on Jenny" protested Ted, what if i told you the people i was on the phone line were very important. What if I told you they were capable of changing our entire lives as we know them.

"I love you Ted, admitted Jenny, but I do not have time for this right now.

Ding! The elevator's doors opened as if on cue wit
