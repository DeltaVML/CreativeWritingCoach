I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Everyday feels like blinking into a different universe, having my soul scattered throughout time and space. Everyone has thoughts, not all of them are interesting, but there is one channel I tune into everyday. One channel that I devote time and energy into tuning into. 

Channel Thuy. 

You see, Channel Thuy has an ongoing story that is worth the watch. Every week, Monday through Friday for one hour before lunch during Homeroom she’s been running her own fantasy story that has been going on for well over two years now, the characters really pull you in and the setting of Mordreem is fantastical and expansive. 

So far, we gotten to what I’ve been calling the Season Finale. She’s reached a tough point, where her main character, Lynn, is at a moral and emotional fork in the road. 

Everything has pointed Lynn to avenging her family’s death, defeating the Demon King Mondo, restoring peace and balance to the world and being able to settle down and - and- 

Well, that’s it. Lynn doesn’t know what to do after all this. Her whole life she’s been focused on revenge. She realizes, after something that could only be considered Lynn falling into a rabbit hole and living her life normally with her family still alive, that she could never be normal. She has grown used to the path of revenge and accepted that in order to defeat Mondo that she must kill him, so that his toxicity can not linger and infest the planet. 

She’s thinking. She’s been thinking about this same question for weeks now. Should she do that? Well, of course, it is for the good of her soul and the world that all the evil in Mordreem must be vanquished. She alone must do it to truly avenge her family. What about Lynn, though? What will she have to live for afterwards? She has lived the life of a lonely orphan Swordmaster for years, there’s nothing more she can do. 

It isn’t like she could go home to a husband, make bread and butter and live domestically. Lynn is disappointed with her future and her past. 

What could ever change her mind?

Thuy is looking up now, answering a question from the professor. She is, of course, correct. She’s been stressed out about her own life and what she should do with herself after high school. Thuy has always been a very friendly and almost popular person her whole life, she’s not top of our class, but she is graduating with most of her honors, and her parents own the best restaurant in the city. 

I’ve known Thuy ever since we were children. She never gets stuck like this with her brain plots. Not even in middle school when she had this odd obsession with killing off her main characters. No, it always fit the plot; Thuy always made sense and it was why I loved reading her thoughts. She was enigmatic and emotional, yet practical and realistic. At least, her brain was. 

I’ve tried to talk to her and make friends before, but was always guarded and unintentionally kept to herself and her groups. She didn’t have time to talk to me. I was the only kid in a private school who was a loner and many of my peers considered me controversial for being outspoken (hence, WHY I am a loner). 

Thuy is also my neighbor and she used to be my best friend when we were younger. She and I used to play Princesses at my tree house or Mermaids in her swimming pool. We stopped being friends as soon as middle school started. When I was able to finally transfer to the same school as her. Before we were so excited by it, and we even planned our whole academic lives together. As soon as we got into the school building, we stopped being friends. It felt almost immediate, but it wasn’t. 

I understand, but it only makes it all the more difficult being able to read not only Thuy’s mind, but everyone else. I became very distant from others, because why be their friends when I can just read their inner most workings?

Lynn is back at her crossroads. Channel Thuy is back to her regularly scheduled program, folks. 

She’s recapping her last thoughts. She keeps doing this, where it feels like filler thoughts that lead up to the same question, and lately, has been coming to a disappointing answer. There is nothing about Lynn’s life that she wants to live for once her revenge is sought out. 

Just then, Thuy makes eye contact with me. I can hear her thoughts. I know what she thinks about me, normally she doesn’t think much about me at all. This time though, all I feel in her head is nostalgia back to when we played our games together. 

Lynn is back, and as she starts to head towards Mondo’s castle there’s a melody coming from the swamp marshes around her. A siren’s lamenting tale is pulling Lynn away, it is then that Lynn’s eyes open wide.

Another filler episode. Great. Thanks, Thuy.


…
        All I can hear, much like an echo through space is Thuy’s voice. “At least I’m more creative than you, Alice.”
