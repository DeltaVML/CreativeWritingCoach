I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The mob was not the forgiving type, I knew I had to hide.

There were at least 3 in the parking garage with me. The one with the trench coat had been downstairs by the fire escape, and the two who had been pretending to smoke by the elevators were swinging in behind me as I walked towards my parked car. 

As I approached the rear bumper of my worn out Toyota I made a choice. 

I broke into a sprint, and behind I could hear the cursing of the mobsters trailing me, calling out to others. 

From the second story awning the building connected to a neighbouring garage under renovations by a amalgam of scaffolding and metal catwalks. I hurdled the waist high wall of the garage and began to climb down the scaffolding ladders into the labyrinthine worksite.

I made it to the ground floor and immediately regretted it. The construction site was a mishmash of exposed rebar, loose debris and broken pallets. I began to pick my way through the poorly lit maze, and several time I paused and held my breath, as I heard other people pass close in the gloom. 

As I approached what I supposed was the exit, I brushed something with my left hand, a table or desk, and a a resounding clatter rang out as metal tools struck the ground, dislodged. 

I broke into a sprint, but as I neared the exit. Someone struck me from behind and world went black. 

When I awoke I was strapped to a chair in the bottom of a pit. From the dim lighting I recognized I was still in the construction site. 

In the gloom above me a solitary cigarette flared with it's owners breath. 

The last shreds of my composure were long gone, "Please I'll pay back the money!", I begged. "I'm good for it you know I am!"

The cigarette flared once more and was released to fall down to my level. Around me I recognised the rising rebar of a foundation yet to be poured and pump hoses connected to a cement pump. 

In the darkness above me, I heard the pump spring into life.

I began to sob and wail as the pit filled, up to my ankles first, then my calves. It constrained my chest as it grew, and as it rose over my mouth and nose I uttered a feeble prayer for my soul, and for a quick death.

And then it was above my head, and in my lungs. Light was taken away and as the cement began to settle and harden the oddest thing happened. 

I didn't die. I couldn't.

Then I tried to scream. 

And couldn't.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
