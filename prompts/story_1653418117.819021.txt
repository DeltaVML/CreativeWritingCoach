STORY:
================================

When Chale called Robert back, she was pleased. Already he had gotten rid of every last spider in the forest. Now she could rest easy. "You have done well, Robert. I do believe this calls for a reward." Smiling, she took him to her bedroom, wanting to savor what would happen. "Now, get on the bed." Robert, however, calmly turned towards her, calmly saying "No."

"Robert, it isn't what you think it is, it's only cuddling..." She decided to backtrack, hoping to persuade him. Perhaps her powers didn't extend that far. Even still, the man shook his head. "I am no longer required to follow your orders. The demons gave me new commands as well as your name, Chale." She was horrified. For such a man to willingly cooperate with demons...

As she tried running out of her house, she was greeted with the sight of spiders, all facing her. The pattern they were in formed a barrier glyph, sealing her inside. Yet soon that was no more than a precaution as with a flick of his wrist, he shut the door and locked it. As she stood there quivering, with her back to the door, she saw a figure begin to step from the shadows. It had four, no, six arms, white hair, and bright red irises, both filled with the intent to hunt. As it stood to its full height, Robert smiled and spoke a single command.

"Sic 'em, Anthony."
