STORY:

The Forbidden playlist, home of many weird and degenerate songs, some of which, make you physically cringe by just seeing their names. And each song yield unpredictable effects, both helpful and negative. You promised to yourself to not use it ever again, since that incident years ago. But, this villain can counter every playlist you have, every ability and every advantage you could rely on. 
As your bloodied hands digit the forbidden six digits on your old and broken smartphone, a rush of fear emerges suddenly, making you feel a chill on your spine. "Shall I really do it?" You ask yourself, but is too late for questions, as the city will not wait. Hesitantly, you press play on the first track.
The first one is made by someone called "S3RL". "Weird name", you think, as the song starts. It's a simple tune, with most of the beats being anime moans and a remixed TTS voice singing how much they wanted a "hentai girl". 
As expected, the first effect instantly happens, and it's just your lungs oxygenating your blood way faster, allowing you to dodge the villain's attacks and lasting way longer than normal.
The second song is pure madness. Extremely violent beats combined with a demonic voice screaming in Latin makes your blood literally boil, allowing for very hot and pressured blood beams to emerge at will, breaking the villain attack.
The third is more calm, yet threatening, made by a "Mori". Just a rap base with a female voice rapping and asking in a gentle manner if "you could excuse her and RIP". This effect made your brain almost overload, making you see in slow motion.
The fourth one is more degenerate, composed of a cover of the song "Despacito" entirely of anime moans and pleasure screams. The effect was very unexpected, since it solidified the blood flow on your arms and in your "lil' buddy" making it a very resistant makeshift meat sword, albeit still painful after each hit.
The fifth and last was just soft anime moans over a silent background. This one your weeb friend sent you so you could relax a little. You expected a terrible effect, however it filled you with determination, making you able to see the villain next moves and counter accordingly and freezing your skin cells to act like a thin sheet of solid titanium.
After just a few minutes and several massive blows, the villain, now on his knees, was weakened enough to be blasted with a boiling blood jet before being decapitated by your meat sword. 
You saw what you did and was extremely ashamed. Your eyes started to tear up before a friendly figure asked you to share your forbidden playlist since if made you so animated to fight and looked like it was full of hits.
After the Battle, you realized that some of the forbidden songs could be very useful in future engagements, and you learned to "manipulate" the random effects of the music at your favor, like changing the speed of the song or adding a different rhythm to it. You learned to accept your somewhat weird music choices and abandoned entirely the forbidden playlist, not before transferring all of the songs to other more appropriate playlists.
