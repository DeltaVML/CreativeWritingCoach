STORY:
================================

"Vraylar, Unrelenting Force, Fell Specter, Decimator of History"  wow someone was going full titles outside my door, that hadn't happened in, hmm I think it's been about three centuries, hell I thought the world had forgotten me, clearly I didn't live up to that last one properly.  
"We of the united world alliance beseech and audience with you."

I could always just ignore them, maybe they'd go away.  I could check on them with some form of magic but that'd take time.  Honestly it was hilarious no one ever figured out how weak I really was.  Just because you can decimate an army it doesn't really mean much if it takes days of preparation, or it wouldn't if they weren't all so damned afraid of me.  I honestly couldn't do many of the minor quick spells because they tended to be unreliable.

I looked at the door to my peaceful little home out in the country.  I had specifically chosen to live way out here to avoid attention.  A momentary bit of nostalgia for when I lived in a fortress that intimidated everyone and kept them from even approaching.  Oh well nothing to be done about it now.  I stepped outside and was surprised, six people, a vampire hiding under an umbrella, two humans, no upon closer inspection a human and one of the fair folk in human guise, a shifter in his mid form black fur bristling claws jutting from his hands and only standing partially upright as if ready to drop to all fours at a moment, a merfolk in their human guise, gills and scales still apparent but at least capable of walking on land, and one of my own kind a pureblood mage his veins glowing with the mana that infused his very being.

I gave a slight bow and a smile.  "Now, what can I do for" a pause as I tried to recall what they'd said.  "the united world alliance.  I don't suppose you simply came to say hello, if you did it'd surely have been preferable to one of your party to wait until at least dusk."

The vampire stepped forward, his pale skin much more clearly visible, the umbrella twirling as he bared his fangs in what I assumed was a smile.  "Vraylar, if I may call you that, you are correct this is not a simple meet and greet."

I shrugged "It is my name and titles stopped having meaning a few, was it decades ago that you united?"

That got a raised eyebrow and a chuckle from the fae who shifted for a moment revealing her wings as she whispered "You owe me."  

I couldn't place which of them she was talking to but it wasn't particularly relevant.  The mage stepped forward glaring at me and begginning to shift his fingers subtlely.  Nope can't have that, I reached out and grabbed his hands in a death grip.  

"If you want these unbroken you will keep them still."  He glared at me but nodded his acquiesence.  I could see the others muscles were tensed, they still feared me, good that'd keep things a bit more civil.  I let go of his hands and looked around at the party assembled for a moment and stepped back from my doorway waving my hand towards the interior.

"Uncivilized of me to keep you all on my doorstep, I apologize please enter freely and know that the rules of hospitality are strictly adhered to in this household."  A smirk from me and most were hesitant to enter but the vampire seemed to be more then pleased to be invited in and out of the sun.  His unflinching entry apparently brought the rest of them tagging along.

I led them through the foyer to the living room and asked if any would like anything.  I saw the merfolk glancing towards the kitchen and nodded before walking off into the kitchen, I decided I'd play it up a bit tonight as soon as I was out of sight I collected a glass of salt water, made a bloody mary with a couple drops of my blood for extra kick and flavor, some milk with just a touch of honey in it, a glass of wine that I'd been saving for a few well a while anyhow, I hadn't been able to peg the shifter so I poured a second glass of wine, and finally a vial of undiluted mana.  Satisfied that each guest would have something worthy of a dignitary I brought all out and set each in front of them.

The vampire and shifter immediately grinned at their glasses, the merfolk was already downing his.  The fae simply picked hers up and stirred it with a finger while the human and mage glared suspiciously.  As I finished serving I realized I had brought nothing out to drink myself.  Oh well, a good host prioritizes their guests.  I sat in my favorite chair looking at the motley crew assembled before me allowing them time to decide on their words.

A sigh of contentment from the vampire.  "A deliciously made drink, I'd swear you've entertained my kind before.  Apologies I realize now none of us have properly introduced ourselves.  I am Solemn Triad of the" I grinned and finished his sentence "of the court of vipers."  He looked a bit shocked then nodded "Just so, I suppose you aren't as much a hermit as we thought if you know me."

I shrugged then "I keep apprised."  pointed at each in turn "Mab of the Fae 3
