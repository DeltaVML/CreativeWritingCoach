STORY:
================================

The first golden rays of the dawn kiss the highest branches of the trees, and with them come the howling.

"The Dawn Herald speaks loudly," old Magister Bramblebrook observes. He is the only one of us strong enough to face the Herald's cacophony unbowed, his nose still to the wind. He has seen many, many dawns, and he has come face-to-face with the Heralds themselves on more than one occasion.

"Acolyte, come forward," the Magister intones. The young man steps forward.

"Evening Herald, accept this our sacrifice, and convey it to thy dread mistress," the old man says. "May She be moved to pity and not to wrath; may She be moved to indifference and not to destruction. May Her hunger be sated by this offering, that She shall not raze our burrows, and may Her heart be softened, that she shall not poison our greens."

My appreciation of the Magister's somber incantation is interrupted by a whisper in my ear -- an observer from the neighboring Underhill burrow. "Fascinating," says Grasserton. "These are based on true events, are they not?"

"They are, alas," I whisper back. "The Cull was many generations past, in the summer of my great-great granddames, but it was devastating. You are aware of the sorcery by which the Great Old Ones raze the grass?"

"Of course," Grasserton says. "We believe it to be a ceremony of great meaning to Them, though we do not know its purpose. We hypothesize that perhaps our reality is displeasing to Them, and They seek to reshape it to make it more resemble Their native plane."

"Whyever it is," I say gravely, "the consequences to our reality are truly dire. In the summer of the Cull, the Great Old One chose to expand the razed area. She summoned mighty terrors, each one larger than a moose, and they... well, the legends give no word to the horror. At the end of it, the whole woods up to the stream had been added to Her demesne, and so it remains even today."

"Why is it called the Culling?" asks Grasserton.

My voice lowers further. It is not well to speak of such things too loudly. "Even the trees were pulled out of the earth, root and branch. Imagine what of the burrows, and their young." Grasserton gasps at the implication. "The Heralds fed well that summer."

At length recovering his speech, Grasserton tried to remain professional. "Ah -- you often mention these Heralds. Who are they -- or what? Are they smaller Old Ones? We at the Underhill burrow have seen such ourselves."

I frown. Small Old Ones? "No. But hark, for you shall see one soon."

The Magister's speech has concluded, and his timing is always superb. The portal opens, and the Dawn Herald steps through.

I feel Grasserton freeze instinctively behind me as the massive coyote's clawed paws touch dirt. The creature steps forward into the light... and Grasserton stiffens further in surprise.

"What's... wrong with it?" he asks.

For the coyote has been twisted and deformed by its servitude. Its fur is short like ours, and like us it has great ears -- though these flop over its face like senseless dead things. The hair on its tail droops down, hanging like moss, and its fur is an unnatural shade of red. As the monster approaches, it becomes clear that its size has been stunted as well; it is perhaps a third the size of its wild kin.

"Such is the power of the Great Old Ones. Life itself twists to Their inscrutable whims." I feel Grasserton tensing up again as the Herald approaches. He does not speak, but his terrified question is written in his every move.

"The Dawn Herald will not come for us," I say. "He is not permitted to pass the boundary." I point out the line of short yellow flags. "We do not know how or why this boundary controls him; our own attempts to replicate these flags have failed... to great loss of life. But lo, for where the Dawn goes, Evening soon follows."

And it is even so. Like a shadow, the Evening Herald has slunk out from the portal -- almost unnoticed behind the thundering Dawn. It slinks toward us, unhindered by the flags that bar the Dawn Herald so completely.

"Go," says Magister Bramblebrook authoritatively... and the young man goes, nose quivering with terror, against his every instinct to freeze or run. We know what will happen next -- the Evening Herald's razor-sharp claws leave no doubt of that.

"Come," I say to Grasserton. "The Evening Herald will take our sacrifice to its master, and perhaps Her awful whimsy will be quelled. Or perhaps not."

We turn our backs on the frightened young man, and do not look back even when he begins to scream.

Such is Her will.
