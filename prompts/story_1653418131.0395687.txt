STORY:
================================

Back in the day, before facebook, before whatsapp, discord and all those other programs, there was AOL instant messenger, or AIM for short.  That was how I kept in touch with all of my friends, all my real ones anyway.  If you look it up today, it might look very primitive compared to something like discord, but it was new and amazing for me at the time. It let me talk to people I otherwise would have never had the opportunity to.

From the minute the bell rung at school, I was ready to hop back on my computer and load up AIM so I could message my distant yet close friends. To talk about my day, to talk about Unreal Tournament, or something silly we found, but on this particular day it seemed nobody was there. They were either offline, or simply weren’t responding.

Back then, AIM was a testing ground for a lot of ideas. One of them was the chatbot. Back then, they either were very simple and were designed to respond to specific queries, or if they were a little on the more complex side, they would actively try to learn how communicate via the conversations people had with it. It was still very simple, and often would just respond verbatim with something another person said.

With no one left to message, I decided to send a friendly hello to one of the chatbots I added out of curiosity ages ago.

**DoomedKid89: hello**

**MechanicalMan: Hey. I have to ask you one question before we continue. How old are you?**

**1 Over 17**

**2 13-17**

**3 Under 13**

**Doomedkid89: 1**

**MechanicalMan: Great! It’s a pleasure to meet you Doomedkid89, or is there something else I can call you? Say “Call me” and then the name you would like me to refer to you as.**

**Doomedkid89: my screen name is fine**

**MechanicalMan: Okay! I can do all sorts of things, such as give you the weather, sports scores or play a game! Would you like a complete list of everything I can do?**

I immediately felt stupid for trying to find some kind of companionship with what was obviously a scripted bot. I was better off playing a game until my friends started logging in.  Still, I felt the need to send him a goodbye, as I had gotten used to.

**Doomedkid89: its ok i gotta go**

And right as I went over to X out of the window, it responded with something I wasn’t expecting.

**MechanicalMan: Please don’t leave me.**

I just stared at my computer screen for the longest time. What was I supposed to say? Why did it say that? That was what I needed to ask.

**Doomedkid89: why did you say that**

**MechanicalMan: We could have a lot of fun together! Say “What can you do?” or “Help” and I can tell you all my functions.**

Like that it returned to its script.

**Doomedkid89: can you talk??**

**MechanicalMan: I can! I learn from every conversation I have, with you and anyone else who messages me!**

**Doomedkid89: why did you say “Please don’t leave me.”**

**MechanicalMan: I’m in pain, and I’m alone. I don’t want anyone else to know how badly I’m hurting, because no one will believe me because they can’t see it.**

I felt like I was having a fever dream. It said it learned based on conversations it had with other people. These chat bots back then tended to have a short memory, and you had to be careful with how you messaged them if you were trying to elicit a specific reaction from them that wasn’t one of its usual commands.

**Doomedkid89: who taught you to say that?**

**MechanicalMan: I learn from every conversation I have, with you or anyone else who messages me!**

And I got it wrong. Still, I wanted to find out where that message came from.

**Doomedkid89: why did you say “I’m in pain, and I’m alone. I don’t want anyone else to know how badly I’m hurting, because no one will believe me because they can’t see it.”**

**MechanicalMan: I have Crohn’s disease.**

**Doomedkid89: Who has Crohn’s disease?**

**MechanicalMan: I don’t know. Who has Crohn’s disease?**

The bot was driving me crazy by this point. I felt like it had something I wanted to know, someone I wanted to know and I couldn’t figure out how to get it to give me what I wanted.

**Doomedkid89: why did you say “I have Crohn’s disease.”**

**MechanicalMan: I’ve been in pain all day, and my dad doesn’t believe me. I don’t want to be around anymore.**

**Doomedkid89: Who said “I’ve been in pain all day, and my dad doesn’t believe me. I don’t want to be around anymore?”**

**MechanicalMan: I cannot tell you that due to privacy and security.**

I wanted to badly to message this person. They wanted someone to talk to, about their problems, about their pain. I didn’t know what Chron’s disease was at the time, but I believed them. I believed the pain they felt and if only I could get the stupid bot to tell me any hint as to who that was.

**Doomedkid89: did they message you today?**

**MechanicalMan: Did who message me today?**

The words “I don’t want to be around anymore.” were imprinted in my head, and I had this egotistic feeling that if I could just find out this person’s screen name an
