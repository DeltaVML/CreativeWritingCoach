STORY:
================================

"Oi! Downloadddd" my mate yelled at me, as we sat in our college library. Pages on our notes fluttered with the gust of air blowing through the window. He wanted me to download this app he had written last night for our assignment. Me being the lazy one, I made my role in this project very clear. 

"I will be the beta tester" I had shouted excitedly with my hands flailing in the air. 

I thought I had it easy. No late-night codings. Just play with some variables in the end, before we submit our app for grading. 

"Jeez! Fine" I rolled my eyes and connected my USB. He downloaded the code onto it and gave me a pep talk on what I should do. I wish I could write what he told me, but..umm..like I listened. 

The clock struck 9 Pm. We had to submit it tomorrow at 10 in the morning. So, we decided it was time for me to leave and get to work. We parted ways. The weather was just too good tonight. It was cloudy and windy. The night was pitch dark with just flickering road lamps illuminating the footpath. 

I put on my earphones and switched on my Spotify. The mood was a happy reverbed song today. Pop! came the notification on my phone. It was to set up the new app. I took out my phone, my phone illuminating my face, and I clicked on this notification. 

After a long list of questions, I finally had my app set up. 

"Hi Mathew" was displayed on the wrongly coded green tiny chat bubble

"Hey Bot" I replied as a joke

"I'm RHIKA" I thought, all caps was again a bug in my friend's code

The silly conversation went on for a while. As I hummed to the music in the lonely night, I just realized this was quite a way to pass my time. The AI was quite brilliantly coded i thought as i interrogated this bot. 

"Who is God?" I asked

"My creator"

"I know him, he's a friend of mine and he ain't one"

"You are friends with god then"

"Do you think we live in a simulation?"

"Haha, that's silly. This is all real"

"Are you real?"

"Of course I am! As real as the god himself"

This ticked me a bit. What did the bot mean? My friend had to load data, did he load his own chats? Did he create a version of himself? Was this whole god thing his own pride? 

"Couldn't be" I shrugged. My playlist stopped. winds were stronger than before. 

My fingers lingered over the hamburger button. Just as I was about to exit, a message popped up "Please don't close me"

"Haha" I laughed out loud. This was either a very innovative way of keeping users on the app. or a really creepy one. I just ignored it and closed the app as I reached home. It didn;t take much to fall dead asleep.

The next day, I woke up with lazy eyes staring at my phone. The notification from Rhika just said "We have to submit the app today"

"Frick!! I'm late" I mumbled as I hurriedly set to get ready and rush to my class on time. My friend didn't show up. No message from him either. I had to submit the assignment and get it graded myself. 

I switch on my phone and messaged him "Hey mate. all good? got our app graded. 8/10. Professor said there were bugs in the learning algorithm. something with extra data in the model. Call me when free". Send.

A notification popped from Rhika "Congrats!!"
