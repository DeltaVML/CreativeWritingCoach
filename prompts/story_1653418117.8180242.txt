I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“I can’t fathom it. He has really been enjoying these last few weeks as my thrall.”
  

  
“Just give him more grueling work. He won’t be so happy then,” replied Quelistiliptinastia (I just call them Quel, Fae names are notoriously long and complex so no one can ever remember or pronounce them)
  

  
I shook my head, “I don’t think so, the worse the work the happier he seems.”
  

  
“There has to be a limit to that facade,” Quel responded.
  

  
“I don’t think it’s a facade..” my very long Fae brows furrowed in thought (they’re actually longer than most Fae, I have to tuck the ends behind my pointy ears, it was a topic of bullying since I was a child. Fae also make great bullies, unsurprisingly).
  

  
“I can’t fathom why a human might enjoy servitude. Hasn’t that been the leading cause of rebellion for hundreds of mortal years?”
  

  
“It has, but this one’s different.”
  

  
“Why?”
  

  
“Well, most humans complain about wanting to go back to their love or their family or their friends, he hasn’t.”
  

  
“You think he has any.”
  

  
“If there is there isn’t any love there. I doubt anyone is even looking for him.”
  

  
“Do I hear remorse in your voice, Felangelinialine? (Just call me Fel).”
  

  
I huffed, “No, he is a human. We have no remorse for mortals.”
  

  
“Good, they are sources of our amusement, nothing more.”
  

  
I shivered, it seemed so callous. Though Quel, in all fairness, was perhaps the most hedonistic Fae I knew. He mostly uses his thralls to get him wine and carry him to bed after he passes out from too much wine. “And sources of your wine.”
  

  
“And that. This is your first thrall, yes.”
  

  
“Well, I had Gwen before.”
  

  
“Gwen doesn’t count.”
  

  
“Why not?”
  

  
“She spend three days wailing and afterward you gave in and sent her back.”
  

  
“I couldn’t just do nothing about it, she missed her family. I didn’t know it would cause such a problem!”
  

  
“You’re hopeless.”
  

  
“You’re heartless.”
  

  
“Then it looks like I’m better off than you. You do feel remorse for them, don’t you?”
  

  
“What does it matter?”
  

  
“It matters. We have a reputation to uphold. We aren’t caretakers, we’re Fae.”
  

  
“The terms aren’t mutually exclusive.”
  

  
“The others won’t like this.”
  

  
“I’ll be better about it.”
  

  
“Then you’ll give your thrall more grueling work?”
  

  
“Yes.”
  

  
“Good. I’m much too sober right now, I have to find some wine. Good day, Fel.”
  

  
I sighed and headed back to my thrall. He turned to me and smiled. Smiled! The nerve of that human. I raised my very long eyebrow, “I am perplexed by you, do you really like being a thrall.”
  

  
He nodded, “Indeed! Never been better! Do all Fae have eyebrows as long as yours?”
  

  
I glared at him, “Don’t you dare insult my eyebrows you…”
  

  
He yelped, “S..sorry. I wasn’t insulting, they’re nice.”
  

  
“You don’t think they’re freakishly long?”
  

  
He chuckled, “Who told you that? Do you need me to beat someone up?”
  

  
I giggled, “That’s cute.”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“That you think you stand a chance against a Fae.”
  

  
“I w..well..”
  

  
“I’m sure you’re a fine fighter against other humans, but it’s just an entirely different playing field for Fae.”
  

  
“I understand. Do you have more tasks for me?”
  

  
“Yes actually.”
  

  
“What is it? Do you want me to feed the Flutterpillars, or clean the Warpsnarps?”
  

  
“None of that, I want you to tell me about yourself.”
  

  
“But in all the rumors about Fae, they always asked their thralls to do things for them.”
  

  
I smiled, “Well, let’s change that.”
