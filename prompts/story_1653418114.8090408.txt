STORY:

"I just want the screaming to stop," whimpered Agares. Bones shifted under his feet as he hiked along the path to the clearing which had been his home for millennia. He clutched the hood of his cloak, pulling it tight against his ears. "Just... Stop... Please..."

The screams did not stop. Neither did the moans, the sobs or the howls. The cacophony of mortal agony persisted. Agares shut his eyes against the sight of viscera along the path, pulling his hood down further. He stumbled and fell to his knees, soaking the hem of his ancient robe in blood. His tears left clean tracks in the blood spatter on his care worn face.

Agares could remember a time, distant but clear, when his home had been free of freshly flayed bodies. It had been beautiful once, held such by Agares' will. A tiny cottage. A meadow dusted with wildflowers. Fresh spring water from the brook. And best of all, no smiting. That was why he had left the light, had chosen to fall. He couldn't abide all the goddamn smiting.

Things had been great for quite a while. Before the mortals. Before the punishment. The first of them had arrived suddenly one day, in a brilliant flash of light, with a note pinned to her back. "If you're not gonna smite for me, you're going to play host. \~ G" Agares was confused but thought it might be nice to have some company. He thought wrong.

The mortals, it seemed, were a Trojan Horse of sorts. They brought with them something the endless fields of Hell were never designed to accommodate. The mortals came with context. They came with perception. They came with Linear Time.

A millennia passed before the troubles started. Agares alerted Lucifer and the council but naught could be done. Hell's ethereal nature began to crystalize under the weight of observation by so many mortals. It's borders became static, it's features predictable. Hell's guests became too numerous. Their minds began to break under the sheer weight of time. It wasn't long until they began tearing each other apart. The violence grew until it was all encompassing.

After a while, a trend began to emerge. New arrivals had the strangest stories. Stories of a hell run by Fallen who torture mortals forever for fun. They even knew some of the Fallen's names. The story was all the rage on earth it seemed. The injustice of it drove Agares slightly insane. His ex-boss was pushing this story, he just knew it. He had to find a way out. Had to get away. He would break open the very gates themselves if he had to.

Agares stopped in his tracks as a brilliant flash of light illuminated the sky and several newcomers crouched frightened on a pile of skulls. The mortals spotted him, their faces turning white at the sight of his haggard face, long black robe, all soaked in blood. "Oh God, oh God," one said. "Is this Hell? Are we in fucking HELL?"

Agares took a steadying breath and shook the blood from his hands. An idea was forming in his mind, the first inkling of hope since he had gone mad. He needed to get out. They needed to avoid insanity and mindless slaughter. He squared his shoulders and, in a commanding voice, said, "No. This is not Hell. Hell is no more."

They stared at him in confusion. One spoke up. "Purgatory then? We're damned aren't we?"

With a heavy sigh, Agares shook his head. "You are not the damned. The damned have no hope."

"What hope do we have?" the same man asked. "What happened here?"

Agares stood a little straighter. "Injustice happened here. And I hope you can help me fix it."
