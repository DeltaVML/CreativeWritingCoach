STORY:

“I think that’s the one. He’s gonna get me.”
“Wait, who? That one. Ha. Your joking right?”, We both watched as he stumbled over himself and face planted in the dirt.  
“Cmon man you literally tripped over nothing. Get up get up! Just use the sword!”, I shouted at him, ofcourse he couldn’t hear me though on account of him still being alive. Well, alive for now. 
“Honestly I think I’m moving around better with one leg”, my companion chuckled beside me. Zombie her shuffled a good distance behind us. She was enjoying this. I was happy she was considering the circumstance. She was my first. And only at this point. It seemed zombie me was even worse then real me when it came to getting anything done. I guess that’s expected, but considering zombie me had only one purpose, one calling, one freaking goal, you would think I would be the tiniest bit good at it. But know. Somethings just seem to follow you into the afterlife, and I just couldn’t seem to escape mediocrity. 

Jinny here, who at this point was doubled over and cackling, was real self righteous. She decided that she would sacrifice herself to stop zombie me. Honestly it was unnecessary, if she knew what she knew now she could of just pushed me down and walked away. Instead she tackled me down a flight of stairs, breaking her leg in the process. I’m pretty sure I only hit her by accident. When her spirit rose I felt so guilty, I had never killed anyone before  I didn’t know what to say to her. Luckily, she found that situation humorous and couldn’t stop herself from laughing. Much like now. 
The idiot I was chasing was crab walking away from zombie me, who was crawling after him. Both of us were moving pathetically slow and at any time, either of us could have just stood up. I was shaking my head, hand over my eyes when the laughing abruptly stopped next to me. When I looked around, Jinny was gone. I heard the noises behind me. A group had come across zombie Jinny and took her out. 

I smiled for probably the first time since death. I had come across countless idiots that would run and scream and just lose their minds at zombie me. But this is first time I was in the presence of hunters, zombie killing commandos. 
“Hey! Hey! I’m over here!”, I was shouting, gesturing wildly to the scene behind me. Maybe the could hear the shuffling, or this poor idiots whimpers. All I needed was him to scream, yelp, call for help. Something. Anything! I turned to him just as zombie me sunk his teeth into his neck. Gurgles. The hunters moved on. I heard the whooshing of a spirit rising. He was sobbing over his body. 
“You had a gun you know. You coulda just…anyways. Welcome to the afterlife.”
