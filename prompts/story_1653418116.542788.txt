STORY:
================================

He stood alone. Lost. Looking in every direction. Abandoned. The high ceiling and narrow walls made his anxiety worse. The tears started to well in his eyes. "I'm a big boy. I can do this." He tells himself.

 He sees her red shirt and her familiar hair. He runs up to her. Embraces her leg. She looks down. He watched in horror as her face changed from his mother's to another. Tears couldn't be held back. Then her voice screamed from the end of the isle. "Get over here you rug-rat. You have to stay close to mommy in the store."
