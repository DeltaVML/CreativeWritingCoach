STORY:
================================

"Halt foul demon! I know of your true name and so you must obey my every command!" 

I tried to take a bite of my taco without spitting it out in shock. 

Today was Cinco de Mayo, and I was expecting guacamole and chips not a demon hunter to be bothering me on my lunch break. 

"Wha- Why would you knowing my name make me obey you all of a sudden?" I said munching on my cheese and meat. I reached for some cheap salsa packets trying to ignore this geek. 

*Halt foul demon?* God this guy sounded pretentious. 

Wait a hot minute! 

How did this guy even recognize me?

*How did he know?!* 

I feared instantly he might be a mind reader, and started chanting "burrito" in my mind repeatedly. Don't think my name! I thought to myself , I pleaded to myself, please do not think my name!  I tried humming songs about raining tacos , and thinking about cheesy quesadillas. So far it was working.

The nerd was definitely a mind reader, because any sane person would have walked away when a person starts singing about tacos to themselves, but he pulled up a chair and sat down with a smile. 

Crap!   

What are you gonna do? Call my landlord or something? I swear humans myths about demon control are the weirdest.. I thought to myself, wondering if he could hear. 

"Oh, I'll do much more than that!" he said wickedly. 

My stomach sank.  

*God damn mind readers!* 

I tried to suppress my thoughts, the ones that were shivering in fear as I took another brave bite of my food. 

Sure, I might have been a demon, but I really did not play well with these god awful readers. Saying your name once would do nothing, but saying your name three times was a whole other matter.

Wait did he know that?

*God dammit!*

I began to think of the ingredients of a Chile con Queso.

Most mind readers in my experience were total shut ins, total nervous wrecks, and here was this guy... spunky as ever. He was not bad looking either. 

*No, not again, Nooooooooooo!!*

Thank the devil, because the man started blushing. Like really turning lobster red. 

This was my chance!

I saw the slightest nervous twitch in his right hand, and laughed at the dork.  

The man got even more embarrassed. 

God, did this freak of nature even know that he had his zip down too? These mind readers were so hopeless, that was why they made horrible demon hunters. What a moron!

The man quickly checked his fly, and that is when I vanished in smoke.

All that remained was my half eaten taco and my phone number. 

Naw, that's a lie. 

I wish I was so brave. 

No, I just ran for the hills like I always do.
