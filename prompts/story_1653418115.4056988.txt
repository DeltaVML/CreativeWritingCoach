I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

He looked like a skeleton.

His hair were only wisps of smoke. His skin was greyed and wrinkled, sagging under its own weight. His arms looked like thin twigs held together by only the vestiges of muscle that could still remain.

But he was alive.

Almost 400 years since he was sentenced for one of the most gruesome mass murders in recorded history.

"How the hell is he even still alive?" the guards asked, almost once a day. His body still accepted the food, though he ate very little. One of the guards swore you could see the food after he swallowed it. No one else had the stomach to watch.

I was told that one of my maternal ancestors had actually witnessed his crimes. That she had hidden and cried as silently as she could when the blood began to seep into her hiding spot. He gave himself up willingly, that was how it was told, but many neglect to say he had snapped the neck of the person who first approached him.

About 150 years into his sentence, people had long since recognized something was wrong. Lawyers, desperate to make a name for themselves, argued he'd served his time. That he was no longer a threat to mankind in his state. He had loudly announced that he would serve his full term. 400 years. The stenographer ended the transcript with only two words, unwilling to be in the room anymore than that. Oddly enough, they weren't even words spoken aloud.

"He smiled."

Looking at him now, I can only imagine what they would have seen.

250 years into his sentence, inmates were attempting to kill him. At least 2 had gotten themselves imprisoned with the express purpose of ending this evil man's life. They died chocking on their own blood. The guards at the time had seen them approach him. Had seen him make an attempt at talking them away. Had seen them strike the first blow. And watched as he crushed their throats.

In the trial afterwards, he was acquitted due to overwhelming witness testimony. His sentence remained. The guards still moved him into solitary, to discourage any other attempts. He didn't seem to mind.

350 years into his sentence, I had needed to find a job. I'd moved from Australia to find better work in Europe. I'd sold my parents' house after they passed to fund the entire trip. I wanted to get back to my roots. Turns out, my roots didn't want anything to do with me.

I got a job at the prison, pretty sure the local rumors of a monster was just that, a rumor. But when I first saw him, he already looked dead. He saw me for the first time and.... smiled, like he recognized me. It was at that moment I remembered the scary stories my mom had shared with me when I was a teenager.

I stayed far away from him.

It's been 49 years since I first joined. He hasn't said a single word that I've ever heard. The records still prove that he has 1 year to go, but I'm not even sure what's going to happen. I drew the short straw so I have to deliver his food.

I stop at his door and open the slates.

He's not sitting down on his bed.

He's standing. The only thing between him and me, is a 3-inch solid steel door. It feels too thin. I can't see his face, but I feel that smile. That feeling of dread, of something that shouldn't be human. But it is. 

I slide the food through, and I see his hands, skeletal and sunken. He grabs it quickly, jerking it away with a force I couldn't imagine possible.

I feel my heart pounding in my chest as I step away. The slate is still open, and I see him shuffle forward to his bed. He turns around and I see his sunken skull of a face, smiling. Not showing all of his teeth, barely a smirk. But he's smiling.

He's staring at me.

He picks up a small piece of chicken and slowly raises it to his mouth, swallowing it whole. I see it as it falls through his chest.

He sucks the grease from his finger, never ceasing that damnable smile.

He raises a single finger, and his cheeks start to stretch as his smile widens.

One more year.

One more year.

One more year.
