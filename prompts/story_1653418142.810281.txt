STORY:
================================

Mr. Baird fished a chess piece from his suit pocket and placed it gently on his desk. It was a bishop. "Do you understand?" he asked.

My babushka taught me the game at an early age. When she was a student in Soviet Russia, chess was used as a political prop to demonstrate strategic superiority. Boys and girls who might otherwise have gone on to do great work as scientists or artists were snatched up by the state if they showed the mere hint of talent in the so-called game of kings. My grandmother had thought one move further than her assessors and intentionally lost a series of crucial matches so that she would not be entered into the hidden Soviet database of Crucial State Assets. If you were deemed to be a CSA, you had the choice between working for the state or to be exterminated by it. My grandmother never became a CSA. My grandfather was not so fortunate.

"It's a bishop," I said, studying Baird's face. "It can only move diagonally. It can threaten a piece all the way across the board."

He frowned slightly. "And this?" he asked, placing a knight beside the bishop.

"The knight can only move in an L-shape, meaning it can cover more ground in the middle of the board. *A knight on the rim is dim*, as they say."

He looked up at me. "They say that?"

I squirmed in my seat. "They say that."

Mr. Baird removed his glasses and made a show of wiping them clean. Then, after letting me simmer in confusion for a short while, he said, "We have a mole."

He could have forcefully shoved the chess pieces down my throat and it would have had less of an effect on me. Because I already knew the agency had a mole: it was me.

After they donated a sizable hole to the back of my grandfather's neck, the state raised my father to be a CSA. They provided him with a CSA wife. And they instructed them both to blend into American society and to produce a culturally-immersed CSA. Me, as it turned out.

"A mole?" I said. I arched my brows to produce a look of what the agency training manual described as Genuine Surprise.

"Indeed," said Mr. Baird. "And I want you to catch him."

For a while we just sat there. The director stared at the two chess pieces while he waited patiently for my reply.

"I'm not sure I'm the most qualified man for the job," I argued.

Mr. Baird scoffed. "You are. Trust me on this."

With that our meeting concluded and I was off to catch a mole. Only that my task was really to find myself, and this idea seemed to me very nice and Zen-like. Of course, I would instead frame a colleague. My parents had taught me how when I was barely 14. All you have to do is to produce a list of ambiguous traits and bind them together with a compelling narrative. Someone hums classical tunes every now and then? They have a strange smell? They have a strange fascination with saltwater fish? You take these traits, which really mean nothing, and you tie them together with a sinister theme. The classical tunes are the same that are drilled into the heads of every Hungarian schoolboy, you say, and the smell is precisely that of farsangi f√°nk--Hungarian yeast doughnuts. And you mention the common cover operations Hungarian agents tend to employ which includes, as everyone knows, fish factories. It's all true, of course, except the fact that there's a link between any of these traits. Three of them is enough to raise subtle suspicion. A hundred? That's damning evidence.

When I returned to Baird's office with my pile of damning evidence, he simply shook his head and again he produced his chess pieces. "Do you understand?" he asked.

This time, I tried to impress him with an old observation handed down to me by my babushka. "The imbalance between the bishop and the knight is what keeps the game of chess interesting."

For the first time, I saw a hint of a smile across his lips. "Go on," he said.

"The bishops are more powerful, but the knights are trickier. It takes more effort to calculate the potential movements of the knight. Their relationship creates an asymmetry. That asymmetry, like Marilyn Monroe's mole, is what makes chess interesting."

"Marilyn Monroe's *mole*?"

"Yes. Symmetry is boring. You need to disrupt it, like the bridge in a song. I'm not sure I'm explaining myself very well."

"No, no. I understand the analogy. What I am interested in is your choice in words. As your object of metaphor, you settled on a mole. Why is that?"

I stared at my pile of documents, then back up at Baird. From his eyes I could tell straight away: he knew. How? I had covered my tracks perfectly. A stupid thing like a choice of metaphor? I felt insulted. He was *right*, sure, but accidentally so. Which should be a crime.

"I have been looking for one for months. It's not strange."

"It's *interesting*," he countered.

I didn't like the tone of his voice. He knew from the start, didn't he? Then why the investigation? Did he want to play with me? Was that what the chess pieces were all about? A foolish cat-and-mouse played to entertain a bored
