STORY:
================================

A gold diped guard, rubys in the pommel. A gift for a warlord, and I was his greatist foe. The blade forged red hot was quenched in my living heart. And so I have inhabited that stretch of steel. I have revenged myself again and again. I tisted the Warlord's heart and turned him on his own wretched empire. And each who came after became my puppet. This night as the moon lay between to mounds of cloud a new hand pries me from my last sorry owner.

I beguin slowly, I whisper in the back of her mind. I wait untill they are desperate, in need of my power. When she lay in the darkest chasim, persued by her worst enemy, their eyes overtaken with tiers of shame and rage! I speak softly "I will make you great, I will give you what you need. I will make all your problems go away" and she held me with cracked fingers and answerd through broken teeth "Not likely".

She clawed and clambored her way out of hell. She drove me into a hundred hearts. Not as an instrument of death, but as if I were a leagth of bottle glass. She didn't kill as a scythe cuts flowers, she vandalised their bodies with cuts. She traded pain and wounds with them till she was standing in a pool of her own blood, laughing! and her enemies where laying in that same mingled pool quiet evermore.

All the while I promised, I wheedled, I worked her heart with my words. I was ignored! This isn't how it goes, I make them strong, I make them kill all their enemies and their enemies families and their whole damn civilization. And then I make them go on killing till they awake from my dark dream coverd in their lover's blood. They kill one last time and I pass into the hands of another. Over and over, forever and forever! But she was diffrent.

"Why don't you want the power I can give" I asked one day, I was so used to whispering it hurt to ask outright. "Nothing's free" the vandal said, cleaning muck off her boots. "I ask for nothing" I pleaded, "Than that's what your help is worth." she said, and I was speachless, after a moment thinking vandal decided the silence was a question "Look mate, today some hag gave me three bits to kill their husband's mistress. I killed the bint, and now I'm three bits ritcher" she explained as to a child. I scoffed! A sword scoff "I could make you a fortune, money is dust to me. I'll give you the world" and she laughed "I have the world, and it's full of scum and some of them will pay to kill the rest. If you offer me a world with more scum you're lying. They're all here"

She weilded me for years, my power grew feint, my rage grew dim. She needed me to be easier to hide, so she had my blade cut short. She sold my ruby pommel, and melted down my gold dipped guard. She rewrapped my hilt of human leather with quiet rough linen. Sometimes when it was quiet I became scared, knowing if she ever found a sharper knife I would be tossed away like a boot with a hole in it. But she died before that, as they all die.

I wasn't a warlord's blade now. I was something she made me. A crude knife clutched in her cold and crooked hands. Her body lay old and dead in some tar stained allyway in a city with mud streets. That night, as the moon peaked between two tiled edifices a new hand pries me from my last sorry owner.

They are a thin wretch of a boy, born to a whore and a dead man. He's two missed meals away from death, doesn't even have a name. I begin slowly, I whisper in the back of his mind "This world is full of scum, and some of them will pay you to kill the rest".
