I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“I truly don’t quite understand what we’re expecting to get from this man.”
  

  
“Perhaps peace of mind, sir?”
  

  
“If they really wanted peace of mind, they would leave him alone. For all we know, interrupting his… whatever he does, will make him unleash a disaster upon us just for—“ the pointy-eared diplomat was cut off by a rough bump of the wood underneath them, making them bite their tongue hard. “AH!”
  

  
“Are you okay, m’lord?” their guard asked as they began to stand up.
  

  
“No, no, I’m fine,” they said with a lisp, raising their hand to brush off the guard. “I justh… don’th understhand…”
  

  
“HALT!” a loud, commanding voice shouted from outside. In an instant, the horses all stopped, and the harsh cessation of movement jerked the passengers around slightly as the wheels of their carriages rolled to a stop. “We’ve… arrived,” the head called out, though they almost sounded unsure.
  

  
Moving to the side, the soldier opened the door, allowing the diplomat to step outside before following suit. With their boots on the ground, they looked around to see the other four diplomats and their security detail out of their rides as well. Every single one of them, though, were looking towards the front of the caravan.
  

  
The manor of the man in question stood multiple stories above the ground ahead of them all; a monument not just to his power, but prowess over the ways of the world. 
  

  
Or, at least it used to be. 
  

  
What once stood out and tall seemed now to sag under the weight of the world. Windows across the entrance, as well as large portions of the walls, were blown out or charred. What wasn’t touched by the devastation and maintained its original shape was overgrown with a greenish-blue moss. 
  

  
“What in the world happened here?” one of the other diplomats called out.
  

  
“It wasn’t like this the last time…” the soldier’s diplomat trailed off as they stared at the old mansion in horrified awe. 
  

  
“Bahira!” the human diplomat called out, grabbing their attention as they approached. “You’re the last one who could’ve possibly seen him before the Skirmishes began, any ideas?”
  

  
Bahira froze for a moment. “What? I’ve no better idea of what is happening here than the rest of you!”
  

  
“Even if that’s true, you’re the only one here who’s already seen him in person,” the human continued, before looking around to the rest of their party. “Am I correct with that?”
  

  
The rest of the group replied with a unanimous response of nods and grunts of affirmation.
  

  
“So,” the human turned back to Bahira. “You’re the most well equipped to know how to handle this situation. Anyone else agree?”
  

  
The crowd grunted and nodded in agreement again.
  

  
“So, what should we do next?”
  

  
Bahira looked to the group in disbelief, before quickly adorning a scowl as they turned away. “Pin it on me, will you….” they grumbled as they looked to the building before the group once more. They brought their hand to their chin for a moment, squinting their eyes, before turning back to the group. “He despised large groups, so if we want to avoid immediate catastrophe, we should send in a select few. Security detail is a necessity to fend off any possible dangers, but we should also send in one of us to instigate peaceful commerce. And for that, I nominate Calba.” as they finished, they gestured their hands towards the human diplomat, who widened their eyes. “Any objections?”
  

  
Their proposal was met with silence, save for the human. “Wait a minute—“
  

  
“It would appear we’ve spoken, Calba! Don’t worry, just don’t mess up and we’ll all be fine!” Bahira said with a sickly-sweet smile. “For your security detail, I figure you’d like to keep your own guard, and I’ll allow my guard to patrol as well, just for extra safety.” As they finished, they gestured for their guard to move over to the side of Calba, which they did. “Good luck with your endeavor!”
  

  
Calba shot a glare back to Bahira before turning and stomping off towards the house with a humph, followed closely behind by his expanded security detail.

Began to write itself past a certain point, so I couldn't get to the good stuff. Ah well, maybe tomorrow.

Thanks for the prompt, OP!

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
