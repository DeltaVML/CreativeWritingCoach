I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Breaking up over text isn't exactly classy, but I ironicly couldn't look her in the eyes "Okay for future ref, taking advantage of someone's disability for personal benifit is a dick move. So is lying about your name. Wait... we cosigned on a condo together, did you commit fraud? WAIT! Is this why you wouldn't meet my parents? Oh god they must have though I was insane, I showed them a picture of us, they probably think I photoshopped that. AGH! You ruined my life!"

I smacked my head against a wall. I was hiding behind humour, I always did "Do you have any idea how much this hurts me? How hard it is every day looking in the mirror and seeing a nobody. As a child I used to follow strange women around the mall, convinced they were my mother till they shouted at me and I had to sit alone crying in the security office while they tracked my family down. I'm frightned of losing sight of the people I care about because to me everyone is an imposter. And you thought it was okay to lie to me? To take advantage of me. You never told me, not after monthes or years, not after I got to know the real you. You didn't trust me, and I can never trust you again" I hit send. I didn't read the reply.

I don't know what her life became after that. Well I do, she's one of the most public people in the world and she seemed to be doing fine for herself. I knew she would hate it, she hates attention. I missed her badly. But I couldn't forgive her, she had known about my condtion before I opend up to her about it, pretended not to. And she never even told me her name.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
