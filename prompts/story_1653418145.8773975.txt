STORY:
================================

“What the hell!” My history teacher yelled as I poured holy water on him. “Whatd you do that for?” He asked me as he began to dry himself with some paper towels that were by his desk. “I’m trying to figure out what you are!” I said to him. “I’m a history teacher” he said flatly. I knew he was lying. He knew details about historical events that would be almost impossible to know unless you were there. To add to that: his eyes would glow. It only happened a few times, but I remember each time vividly. The first time was when we were learning about Egypt, more specifically about what happened to Cleopatra and Mark Antony when Octavian entered Alexandria. The second time was when we learned about the battle of Stalingrad during WW2. The 3rd time was when we learned about the Tet Offensive. Each time his eyes glowed a dim yellowish color, I wasn’t sure of it at first, but after the most recent time I knew he wasn’t human, he couldn’t be. So I did what I thought was right, wait till after school and dowse him in holy water. 

We paused for a moment. “Sit down for a second James.” He said calmly. I hesitatingly sat down. He looked me in the eyes for a moment before his eyes started glowing again. “Congrats kid, you’re the only who noticed, but holy water won’t do the trick here.” I froze unable to speak, unable to move.  “Go home James.” He said calmly yet sternly. I stood up slowly and began to walk out the door, as I approached he spoke up again, “don’t try to find out what I am, ok?” I nodded lightly and walked away as calmly as I could.
