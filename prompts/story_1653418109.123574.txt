STORY:
================================

Its literally just the venetian snares album "Rossv Csillag..." 
When the music stops, the horrors &amp; gruesome excruciation you have wrought brings you to your knees. All the fires increase visibility, as the lack of standing structures has caused the wind to whip up &amp; blow away the bulk of the smoke. 

You can see exactly what you've done. There is not much left to see.

When they find you, deep in the crater, they just start shooting. No greetings or attempts to identify, just muzzle flares &amp; the curt bark of their weapons. You truly wish that they, or any mortal, had anything remotely like the means to stop you. 

You realize now that you've always been the villian. The monster was always you. 
How could you ever think you could control this? Or that this would all end well? 

As their bullets clatter around you, another grim realization blossoms in your mind: No one can control you, harm you, stop you... 

What law, writ by mere men, could constrain the likes of you? 
What authority could demand your obedience &amp; subservience with impunity?
Why, then, serve those who are so plainly weaker than you?

As they pause to reload before another volley of impotent annoyance, your finger hovers for a long moment over a small triangular button engraved with the word "PLAY" in a boring &amp; perfectly crisp font.
