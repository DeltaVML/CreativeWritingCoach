STORY:

The crane towered above me like an angry uncle. My shoulders began to ever so slightly shake. Sweat slid down my cheeks in jagged lines. I had forgotten to slip, so slopping and slapping was a far fetched notion for me on this particular day and my skin was charring slowly. I wasn't really *there* that day.  I could already taste the sausage roll I would inhale at break time like I had so many times before. 

I had tried to make friends with salad but time and time again, I had convinced myself that our personalities simply did not align. My missus hopes for a change of heart but at this point I have no intention of sitting down for a heart to heart with a bowl of steamed broccoli. Sometimes joy is healthy too, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that one can consume too much salt or sugar. 

My mind started to wander aimlessly away from the monotony of my glamorous career in building and maintenance. I may have been standing in the blazing heat in the middle of a huge, ugly construction site, but in my mind, I was sipping a cocktail on the shores of a Bali beach. I could taste the fresh passion fruit, I could smell the lobster sizzling on the charcoal barbeque out the front of my favourite beach-side restaurant. What did he say the method was? Shell stays on, one side for two minutes... Or was it three minutes shell side down...

*RRRRING* 

I was transported immediately back to the exotic western suburb of Penrith, the lunch bell had sang it's beloved song; smoko was upon us. I put the crane down carefully, ensuring I didn't wobble it too much and send the operators on a surprise trip to heaven. I lit a fag and called the missus.
