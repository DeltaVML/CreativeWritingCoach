I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I regret everything. 

I watch helplessly as the greedy salesmen coax my undead body to their unmarked van with pizza and cocaine. It really makes you reflect on things when more than family or religion, your body remembers your addictions. And here I am, a ghost, watching my dumbass zombie self get captured by the Dark Magic Company. Even though my brain isn't sending signals and my shakes are long gone, my soul writhes with need. I want a pizza... or cocaine. Ideally both at the same time. 

I follow the black van to the Dark Magic Company headquarters, and boy does the hate roil in my soul. There's nothing to ground me since I'm made of 90% emotions now. The frustration that they would steal my body and the jealousy for all these living workers propels me to fly through them again and again, futilely hoping that I can haunt and possess them. 

But of course, it doesn't work. When I finally calm down, I track my body into the basement of the recycling facility. I thought they recycled plastic or cardboard in here, but from my vantage, it looks like they recycle bodies. 

I rear back in confusion as autonomous arms clean my body gently. The fungus controlling my brain snaps my teeth at the nozzles, but my body is restrained by thick plastic belts. It's like watching a zombie car wash. A whole line of the undead go through the water, soap, and waxing phases. What the shower doesn't clean is enchanted off by minimum wage mages at the end of the conveyor belt. 

There are two mages. One gets the dirt and grime, while the other restores peeled skin, torn muscles, etc. 

For the first time since I died, my need for cocaine (and pizza) diminishes until I can't feel it rattling my spirit. Hope blossoms in me that perhaps the Dark Magic Company can bring us all back to life. None of us ghosts can see each other, and I hunger to interact with another being. 

I follow my body as it's inspected and transferred onto a second conveyor system. I sit next to my undead head, waiting for the next room, holding the excitement at bay. 

The machines put clothes on my body, a jumpsuit, but that's nothing to be alarmed about. If they are bringing the mass of zombies back to life with a cure, they probably chose the clothing that's easiest to manage in the supply chain. After that, my hair is combed and another mage feeds me some sort of mana mush and directs it straight through the skin to my stomach. 

When my body and I reach the last hundred meters of the conveyor belt, I curse with all the disappointment I felt as a kid when my ice cream fell on the floor before I could lick it. 

My body is being stuffed into a plastic box, set up like a barbie set. Loud, joyful colors cover the packaging with happy faces and polka dots. The box is twice the size of a coffin, and the trendy marketing text is slapped on the front. It says, "Necromancer's Dream Slave," and, "Lifetime guarantee. We'll even kill it again if its soul comes back!"

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
