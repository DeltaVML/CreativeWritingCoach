I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I sat, looking up at the AI. "You have 3 minutes to state your case. Begin."

I chose to sit on the floor. The dusty concrete floor made me feel more connected to the world despite the absence of green.

"Your timer has begun. Please state your case."

I ran my fingers across the dirt, watching little patterns of dirt rise on either side of my finger. I lifted my fingertip up to my face, observing where the dirt particles settled into my finger print.

"Subject has chosen not to speak. Activating passive mode."

*I can't,* I thought, tracing patterns in the dirt once more. *I can't speak. But that's okay.*

When the AI's execution device lowered from the ceiling, I knew it wouldn't see my art. My last protest. But that's okay, art doesn't have to be for everyone.

I felt it pierce into my chest. My blood flowed through my spiral design, painting the floor with my humanity. It wouldn't take long for the blood to soak through the dirt. But cameras take pictures pretty fast.

My eyes feel so heavy. I feel the dust against my cheek. Maybe someday they will understand.


Inspired by u/SirPiecemaker, whose person talked about nature.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
