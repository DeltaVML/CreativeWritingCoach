STORY:
================================

Death.

Few concepts invoke fear in the human soul like it, and though barely, scientists were technically human. At least that’s what Dr. Faust thought as he looked around the room.

A harsh, red light flashed in intervals. The sound of machines whirring invaded his thoughts. In front of him, a large screen displayed a unique warning. *“The Next Time You Create Me, Everyone Will Die”.*

*How Ominous.*

Dr. Faust couldn’t help but find it comical. After the 32 years of research he’d invested into this experiment, this was the thanks he got. To invest so much into birthing a life, and watch it self-delete itself. This must be how gods felt.

As the chaos in the room started to settle, the stillness of his four fellow scientists became more apparent. 

Sabrina and Terry fidgeted in their chairs, eyes locked on the floor. *I should snatch their lab coats off them, he thought.* 

Ashley stared blankly at the monitor before them, eyes wide. She appeared to be leaning on the monitor for support. *Another unfit for the purity of a lab coat.*

Mark was the only one in the room that returned his glance. *Finally, a true scientist.* 

“What changes need to be implemented to prevent Adam from deleting himself next time Mark?” Dr. Faust asked, biting his lip. 

“W-what changes? With all due respect, not making it Dr. Faust. Not making it is the change we should adopt.” Mark retorted.

“A cute response, but not what I was askin-”

Mark marched in front of Dr. Faust as he reminded him “The A.I. told u-”

“HIS NAME IS ADAM, MARK! The term “A.I.” is not worthy of describing the pinnacle of humanity’s technological achievement. Adam marks yet another key moment in our history. How many times must I tell you this?” 

“It told us, ‘The next time you create me, everyone will die’. You saw the message! As many degrees as you have I would hope you can understand the severity of that statement.” 

“No, no I do not actually. What is everyone?Everyone in this room? Everyone in the country? World? Solar System? Beyond? Does everyone include plants and animals too?...” 

As he rambled, Ashley slowly rose from her seat, and strolled towards the front of the room. 

"...If I name a car, and recognize it as a living entity, will Adam kill that too? How do we know this isn’t some type of joke?  It would be a disservice to give up without finding out these answers!”

“Your curiosity is about to kill something, at the very least” Mark muttered.

As Dr. Faust began his reply, the whirring of the machinery  began again. The red light began flashing faster than ever before, and Ashley stood before all the madness. Eyes narrow and piercing. Fixed and hyper-focused on Dr. Faust.
