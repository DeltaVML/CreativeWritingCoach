STORY:

Amelia and her would-be murderer were having a lovely evening, all things considered. When the tall, handsome stranger had confronted her in her apartment, and told her that he had been hired to kill her, and meant to complete the contract,  he'd also asked her for a last request, saying he'd grant it, if it was in his power.

So she'd asked him out on a date. It was stupid. It was *insane.* But it was the first thing that popped into her head, in the moment. He'd just smiled, and told her he'd wait while she got ready.

His name was Anders, or at least that's what he said she could call him. And, despite being a cold-blooded murderer, she had to admit, he knew how to show a girl a good time. Her impending death aside, the club had been fun, and the restaurant he'd taken her to was world-class.

It was crazy, she thought, how *calm* she was about the whole thing. Of course, Anders had told her up front that all she would accomplish if she tried to flee or call for help on their date, was cutting her last request short, and perhaps getting people around her killed in the bargain, so it wasn't like there would have been any *point* in screaming or panicking.

But even so, she was surprised by how *unbothered* she felt, regarding her imminent murder. She'd had an Aunt who worked in hospice care, who had once told her about a strange serenity that would sometimes settle on people who knew their time was up, and that they couldn't do anything about it. "The Peace of the Dying", she'd called it. Maybe that was it.

"So, it's been bugging me all night. I have to ask, " she began, swirling the wine her glass idly as she looked at Anders across the table. "What if you'd asked for my last request, and I'd said 'Don't kill me?'"

He chuckled, and shook his head. "Sorry, Amelia. I'm not a *genie,* or some kind of storybook creature bound to fulfill the letter of his promises. I would have just said no."

She laughed, somewhat bitterly. "Yeah, I guess I kind of figured that. Then, can I ask *why* I'm being killed? You're an assassin, not some sort of...*serial killer,* right? Why does someone want me dead?"

He shrugged. "I'm afraid I can't help you there, either. At the sort of price points *I* work for, the client expects the job to be done *no questions asked."*

She raised her glass to him, wryly. "Oh! Well, at, least I'm being killed by a *high-end* assassin."

He smirked. "One of the very best, if I do say so myself."

She shook her head, chuckling. "This is so stupid. I *know* you're going to *kill* me! We wouldn't be on this date at all, if it wasn't my *last request!* So why the hell do I find you so damn *charming? "*

He cocked his head. "Who says we wouldn't be on a date if it weren't your last request? I'm sure I'd swipe right, if I came across *your* picture."

Amelia hated how the comment made her blush. "Thanks...wait, assassins use *Tinder?* Damn, I thought my mom was just being paranoid or old-fashioned, when she told me I was going to get *murdered* by dating on an app."

He laughed, "It's not like that. I never mix business with my personal life...not usually anyway."  He glanced at his phone on the tabletop, and his expression turned sober. "I'm afraid it's...about time, Amelia."

She nodded, sadly.

They went back to her apartment, and stood awkwardly in the middle of the living room, looking at each other like two teens on their first date. Finally, Amelia spoke.

"I know I've already had my last request, but...one last dance?" she asked, softly.

He put on some music, and held her close, as they swayed across her living room together.

"You really...you're really going to kill me, aren't you?" she whispered.

"The client wants you removed. I took their money. So, yes I have to kill you. It's not just the money...it's a matter of principle, at this point." Anders said, apologetically.

"Assassins *have* those?" she asked, wryly, resting her cheek on his shoulder.

He chuckled, bitterly. "Yes. Even if you discard the most basic principles that hold society together -- thou shalt not kill, and so forth -- you have to have *some* kind of personal principles that you stick to, or you can't function as a person, not in the long run."

She sighed. "So...how are you going to--"

She felt a tiny pinch on the side of her neck. And then, she felt nothing at all.

\---

When Amelia woke up, she wasn't in her apartment. She was laying on a double bed, in a cheap but relatively clean motel room. Her head ached fiercely. As she groggily took stock of her surroundings, she saw that there was a tube stuck in her arm, leading to an IV stand by the bed. The bed itself was littered with medical supplies and equipment: syringes of epinephrine, an automated electric defibrillator, and several empty vials of various injectable medications.

On the night stand by the bed, she found a very thick stack of $100 bills, and a sheaf of legal documents, including a driver's license, a passport, and a birth certificate. The pho
