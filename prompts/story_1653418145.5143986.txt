I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

There are those who look at magic and see a phenomenon that boggles belief and breaks down every universal rule known to man.

They are incorrect.

Magic actually follows along the lines of modern scientific research. In fact it was esteemed ninth plane sorcerer Sojournis, who discovered that magic follows both conservation of mass and Newtonian laws.

I, despite being the sorcerer supreme of our times, am no exception. In fact, I prove the rule.

Other mages see me as a outlier. An outlier of the outliers.

Why? Because while their magic takes but moments to recharge, mine take days.

Magic comes from an internal source each human has, called mana. When you run out, you can't cast any more magic. Recharging depends on your metabolism and available resources.

If you're starving and sick? You don't recharge at all. Full stomach? Wait like a minute until you can cast fireball again.

This tendency of course makes magicians the most useful of all clases. Even legendary warriors know better than to piss off a magic user. 

There are very few individuals who can cast fireball after fireball without pause.

And I'm certainly not one of them.

Then why am I sorcerer supreme?

Well...

When i was young, I came upon an anthill while playing. Being a child of five, i began to destroy the anthill using stones and water. I found out quickly however that this act resulted in the death of my new ant friends, for whom i was trying to install a water slide in the middle of their hill.

Distraught, I clapped my hands together and asked for them to "wake up" once again.

And they did.

That's how it became clear to all that I was not a normal mage, but a necromancer.

A ressurector.

I have the power to mend mortality. To reverse aging. To cure cancer.

None of these are easy tasks. The toll on my body is immense. It breaks me down to my core, literally, the cost of my magic.

Such is the prize to pay for control over the plane beyond life.

And yet, despite all my trials, i do not grow old.

Due to my interference in its domain, death has denied me it's visit.

I do not gripe. I know magic has a purpose for me. And i found out about it only a few days ago.

Being a student of both science and sorcery, my lab is packed with all sorts of equipment. A friend of mine, an astrologer, informed me of a curious distrubance she saw on the surface of our sun.

A few consultations later, we realised our star was dying.

I sighed and finished my cup of tea with a finality i thought i would never experience.

Now, i make my way to my altar for the last time. My students have gathered my materials. My followers have said their goodbyes. All my close ones have moved on to death, despite me offering to use my powers.

As for my magic, i know i am to use it one final time.

I raise my hands, summon the power within, and begin to ressurect the sun before it turns into a black hole and swallows us all...
