STORY:
================================

This doesn't work;

Taken from a Christian perspective, where several of these tales come from, the origin of the devil, as many have misunderstood, is not to " take over heaven" , but, to " unmake" reality, by making the word of god double back on it's self, so, he wouldn't have to exist.

Aka; satin is a suicidal bitch boy.

Taken from the Japanese perspective, the only other I am familiar, with cursed swords existing in;

The cynicism could not be a hero, as, they would have no drive, to do " great things".

From ether of the two perspectives I know, it is not possible for a cynisist to be a hero, as, they would pack the drive, to not be a " dark one" , from the get go. Aka; the swords job was done, before it got there.

A realist; sure. They could establish there motive, and, be a realistic actor, changing the sword.

A survivalist; definitely. As long as they were fighting for there own survival, they could bring that out in others, or, simply save the world, in order to live.

However, a simple, pure, cynicist, is incapable of these actions.

If they were capable of them, they would not be a cynisist. They may " declare" themselves a cynisist, in the same way hilter declares themselves a socialist, or, a modern socialist, would declare america purely capitalist.

However, if America is capitalist, with Medicare, Medicare, class 2, charitable businesses, and illegal / unenforceable contact appearances, through human rights violation, then, by the same token, Nazi Germany, must be socialist, as, they still largely delclaired themselves as such, and, in there twisted version, still trended to greatly follow socialist idea forms.

Likewise, if Nazi Germany was not socialist, through lack of a " pure" socialism, then, by the same token; America isn't capitalist, due to lack of a " pure" capitalism .

The same here, must be said, of the cynical hero;

If the hero isn't corruptible, and, still a hero, then, they are not a cynicist.

Meanwhile, if they are a cynisist, and , pre corrupted, taking everything in it's " darkest" , most fertile value, then, they are not a hero.

The prompt may as well propose; the sword cannot corrupt the hero, due to them being a train spotter

Or

The sword cannot corrupt the hero, due to them being a pottery enthusiast.

Both of those may seem absurdist. However, they are FAR less contradictory, then, the cynisist, and,  a " incorruptible hero" , in the same token.

A nhilist? Sure. There is a point where, if things have no meaning, you can argue, that, it's best to make your own.

A realist? Definitely. Those who look at things from multiple viewpoints, and, account for realities " stacked effects" , contradictions, and path, is perfectly logical.

But, a cynisist? Who, by definition, must see the " darkness" in things, taking them to it's gloomiest tone, AND, think that realistic is pointless, without reward, and, to seek " forward motion" is folly?

Now, THAT , I say, dear sir, is.... Is NO hero. : (
