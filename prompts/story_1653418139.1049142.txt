STORY:
================================

"DUDE THIS IS LIKE THE 37TH TIME!" shouted death with hilarious annoyance at this point.

"You can't even handle the swarm? What is wrong with you man?" he complained. By now I had experimented with so many different configurations that I must have been nearing 1000 tries. Maybe more than that.

I had slipped up and switched bodies. People usually call that 'death', but we just call it switching.

The last one was weird. It was built upon satanic boundaries, and I sort of opened up a void that we decided to turn into my bank account.

"Well, I'm glad I made you agree to begin to figure it out on your own man." he said.

"You took that 1% and really turned it into must be about .01%." he continued.

"Really proud of you, son." he finalized, before porting me right into the middle of mayhem, which I really wasn't looking for.

I'm not excited about this, but now there is a person running at me with a sword.
