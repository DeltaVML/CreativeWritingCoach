STORY:

They had done better this time, I will admit. 

At first, it was the humans. Tempestuous, passionate, short-lived, they threw themselves on my mercy, pleading for an end before another of their mayfly generations were consumed.

Then, the fae, in their multitudes. A whole coterie, as varied in form as the animals from whose shapes they evolved. They plied me with art, physical and magical, songs sung from a dozen throats, each more haunting and beautiful than the last. 

The dwarves and Kin-Of-The-Earth came after, and they brought riches beyond imagination. Currency and precious metals of every shape and lustre, flowers that bloomed once a century, they even sacrificed themselves for my benefit.  The Court of Autumn hewed out their heartwood before me, and each of the three dwarven lords plucked out their jeweled left eye to place with them, sacrificing their longevity as tribute.

Last came the Ophidians, those proud and august creatures, they offered their own young, the firstborn dragon eggs from the broods they shepherded, giving up the very future of their race if I should yield to their pleas. 

I turned them all down.

But this time, I will admit, they had done better. They came together, minus one. I looked among their party for the Kin-Of-The-Earth, but the only wooden forms came in the long walking sticks they bore. Still, they were together, as their ancestors had been so long ago. The irony wasn't lost on me. They met me in my mountaintop hermitage, where the four winds met, and I confess to being a bit flustered. I had not received visitors in quite some time, and feared my hospitality may be lacking. Still, I made the best of my larder, producing a passable stew by adding what remained of their rations to the hard-scrabble tubers that grew on the slopes near my home. Conversation was minimal as I cooked, and as we broke bread, silence, my old companion, dominated the table. Punctuated only by the scrape of spoons in bowls, darkness crept over my home, until we were only lit by the low tapers that stood erect amongst the remains of our meal. I sighed and began to clear the table before the representatives broke the spell circumstance had laid over us all.

"Magus, we come before you, humbled." The human princess spoke first. She was lovely, but dressed in functional mail and leather, and carried in her eyes the same fire her great grandfather had when he had approached me first. "We have assembled before you one last time, to beg an end of this calamity." 

"Oh?" I gathered up the bowls, and poured spring water from an earthen jug for all who desired. 

The dwarven king licked his lips before he spoke next, his voice as deep and coarse as the booming of a rockfall grating in some stygian cave. "The peoples of this world have suffered from hubris long enough. Our efforts of our industries to stem the tide have brought ruin to our lands. The waters turn sour, and the earth crumbles to dust beneath our plows."  His stoney skin was weathered now, softening the hard crags he sported when we first met. Under my gaze, he fidgeted with his eye patch, and I belatedly realized it was made of leaves that had not grown since the Withering. Ah, I suppose that's why there was no member of the Court of Autumn...

The fae delegate began to weep, sweet smelling nectar flowing from their liquid brown eyes. "We know what our peoples had asked of you," they hiccoughed. Gods, they were young! "But has it not gone too far? What price must we pay to end this? What cost have we not already met?" 

The Ophidion drew them close, and the fae climbed into her lap, collapsing into sobs. To her credit, the Empress of Blood and Sand met my eyes without wavering, her voice as strong and patrician as I remembered. "Our time flows away from us, with no reprieve in sight. The last of my people fight to keep your blight from overtaking us even now. When will you repeal your magicks?"

I could not help but shake my head. "My blight? My evils? My cost? I think you know better than any that it was your precursors that wanted this." 

The dwarven king smote the tabletop with one granite fist, causing the light to flicker as the candles danced under his assault. "We wanted a better world! A united world! An end to the pointless tribalism that divided us, consumed us! Not this hell you have wrought!" He seemed fit to rage further, but subsided at a touch from the human princess. "Forgive him, Magus. We only seek to understand why you continue to inflict such punishment on us, for wanting a better world."

Laughter came to me then, bitter and unfamiliar. "I gave you exactly what you wanted. Your people wanted a means to bring each other together under one banner. A means to put aside your petty squabbles and join to face the world. I gave you exactly that. You ask what cost you must meet? What further sacrifice must be made? Ask yourselves why you only seek to pay it now, as these dark waters close over your heads. Ask yourselves why y
