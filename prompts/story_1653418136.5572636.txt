STORY:
================================

Jeffy was terrified. I shoved down my irritation. It was 2AM, and I had *work* in the morning, dammit, but I knew it wasn't his fault. I'd been there, at that age, after all. At least, unlike me, Jeffy had someone to explain what was going on and help him through it. 

I walked in to his room and saw Alice crouched by his bed, speaking softly to the Jeffy that was under it, trying to calm him down, and I smiled. I love that woman, she works so hard to cope with her crazy husband and kid.

But this was definitely something the boy needed Daddy to help him with.

So, I took a deep breath, and I *split.* One of me went to the closet, one of me sat down on the bed,  one crouched down beside Alice, and another walked down the stairs to scoop up the Jeffy down there. In a few moments, one of me was holding each of the Jeffys, and sitting on the bed together.

Of course, they were all terrified of each other, and all of me had to hold on to all of my squirming son, to keep him from bolting.

"Sorry kiddo, but I'm bigger than you, you're not going anywhere. You're staying right here until you calm down." all of me said, in a gentle but firm voice.

And after a few moments, they did. I squeezed them all, reassuringly.

"That's my brave boy," I said, continuing to speak softly and in unison with myself, to emphasize the point I was explaining. "We talked about this. What did Daddy tell you about your duplicates? Remember? No matter how many of me there are...?"

Their response was a cacophony of answers spoken at different times, so I shushed them.

"No matter how many of me there are...?" I repeated, firmly.

The Jeffies took a deep breath.

"They're all still me." they said, in unison.

All of me smiled. "That's right, son. Remember, *everybody* has more than one of some parts of them! More than one finger, more than one toe, more than one hair on the top of your head. You and me are just a *little* different, that's all. Sometimes you and Daddy have more than one *body.* But just like fingers and toes, all of the parts of you are *still* you. I know that's hard to remember sometimes -- especially if you accidentally duplicate in your sleep -- because you can panic, and your brains can get confused, and forget they're all really part of the *same* brain, for a minute."

The Jeffies nodded, movements now perfectly synchronized.

"Now, remember what else we talked about? Just like with your fingers..." I held out my hand, fingers extended, and then slowly curled each one in. Jeffy closed his eyes, and concentrated. One by one, the duplicates disappeared, merging back into the singular Jeffy. As each additional Jeffy vanished, I recalled my own duplicates.

And then it was just me and Alice, holding our one beautiful boy between us, until he fell asleep again.
