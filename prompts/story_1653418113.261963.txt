I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Chaos theory, or the Butterfly Effect is familiar with everyone. Everyone of us know that a butterfly flapping in Texas could create a violent storm in Brazil. To create dramatic stuff, it is easy.

But with trillions of butterfly flapping wings endlessly across the world, the force will anull eachother in a chaotic swirl of uncomprehensible, massively complex process. A system with only 3 objects is already incredibly unpredictable, and this world is the system with 69 gigachad-sextillion objects, each on its eldritchly complex way.

The hard part is in controlling the process.

And that's my work.

I'm the master of fate, the controller of chaos, and a thousand more names I give myself. I can blink and tomorrow I will find myself win the lottery. I can throw a rock, that rock will hit another rock, then hit the air current which will affect the global weather slightly, and somewhere thousands of kilometers away, a guy working with airplanes will get slightly annoyed and distracted from his work by a gust of wind, and when that plane fly over my head a week later, a door in the plane chamber will malfunction and open out mid air, making all the candy and chocolates in the plane fall down, creating a candy rain in my neighborhood.

Theoretically, everyone could do anything if they act the exact way they need to act. But I am the only one that can nevigate through the currents of reality, and build a dam to controll it.

I am sitting in a coffee shop in Texas, enjoying my life. Finished my coffee, I walk out the shop, purposefully knock over a salt shaker, the salt inside fells out and splash everywhere on the marble floor.

The next day, after an exhausting flight, of course made free by some dumb luck I absolutly did not create, I end up in Fiji for a tour. I buy a newspaper despite the fact that I do not know any Fijian. I only know it will be useful later.

The day after that, the Internet is full to the brim with the story of a French guy trying to rob a bank using a grenade, but mistakenly bring a green avocado with him instead, and not realising it and use the fruit to threaten the staff. Yeah, that was hilarious, wonder why someone would be so dumb.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
