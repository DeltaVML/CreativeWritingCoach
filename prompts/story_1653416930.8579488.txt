I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

You look around at the table before you. You’re not sure how you got here, but you’re here. You don’t mean to eavesdrop, but you can hear the light chatter amongst the clatter of dishes and utensils.

“How far along is the baby?” You ask in a poor attempt to start a conversation.

Father Time and his wife share a look, look back at you, then answer, “Seven months.”

“That’s… great. Congrats.” The atmosphere seems to get even more awkward because of your attempt.

You flip the pasta on your plate once more. “Thanks for inviting me.”

“You're welcome.” You just want to get this over and done with. You did _not_ work your ass off for years just to be forced to eat dinner. _Why_ did you agree to this?

_’It was either that or start the ritual all over again.’_ You remind yourself. Stupid sacred rituals.

You focus as your fork scapes on your plate underneath. Father Time is working on getting his father, Grandfather Time, to eat. Mother Time, on the other hand, keeps exclaiming that the baby is kicking.

“Grandfather, please, eat your food. I’d rather not do this in front of a client.”

“Any names?” You want a distraction. Grandfather Time is getting louder with his complaints. Anything but this. _Anything._

“Well,” Mother Time starts. “We’re thinking of keeping the theme running. Baby Time or Child Time would be wonderful names!”

You nod to appease her, and it works. In all honesty, you think those are _horrible_ names but you’re not here as a consultant.

You don’t know how long you sit and eat. Maybe an hour? Two? Three? Four? Six, even? When it’s over, you scurry out and into his office as your told. You watch Father Time walk in with food on him and he immediately gains your respect.

“So,” He says, straightening his tie. “What do you want, mortal?”

“Y-you know what? I think- I think I’ll just wait until next time.”

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
