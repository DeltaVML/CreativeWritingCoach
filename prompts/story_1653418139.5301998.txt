I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Oh, screw you! Don't blame the science department for this mess. The science went PERFECTLY. It's not OUR fault that corporate decided to skimp out on the compound's security and containment systems!" Dr. Bentley said, hotly, jabbing a finger at Miranda, the corporate liason.

"Uh, *excuse me?*" Miranda hissed, narrowing her eyes and slapping her palms down on the table, angrily. *"Skimp out?* I've been busting my ass for *two years,* getting corporate to shovel more and more funding into this *money furnace!* I've been going to bat for this damned project since before you had anything more to show for your little dimensional travel theories than some half-assed equations scribbled on a whiteboard!"

She whirled to face Jenkins, the head of Project Engineering. "And you! I got *you* more than enough money for security and containment! What the hell did you spend it all on, *blow and hookers?"*

Jenkins scowled, "Don't even start! I left more than *half* that money in the budget unused, to cover projected cost overruns! You're the one who kept saying we needed keep costs under control!" He turned to Bentley. "And it's not like *Dr. Numbnuts,* over here, gave me *any* indication that we'd have to secure and contain--"

"Enough!" Thomas, the Operations Director roared, slamming a fist down on the table. The rest of the attendees were immediately silenced, as the middle-aged senior VP in charge of the project withered each of them with his implacable gaze.

"We can play the *blame game* later, you morons!" Thomas growled. "*This* meeting, right now, is about one thing, and one thing *only..."*

He paused, glanced under the conference table, and grimaced at what he saw. Reaching down, he seized hold of something that squeaked in protest as he grabbed it, and then dropped it roughly onto the tabletop.

It was a little man with pointed ears and a long beard, about three feet tall, dressed in colorful clothing and a tall pointy hat. The tiny interloper glared around the table, angrily, and shot them a rude gesture with both hands.

"...what in the *f\*\*\** are we going to do with all these *gnomes?"* Thomas demanded.
