STORY:
================================

The sun gazed happily upon Mac as he stepped into the town. His armor and clothing were thoroughly doused in blood. His sword hung by his side, his bow sling over his shoulder. His blond hair was now a mass of matted red-brown, dyed by blood, sweat, and muck.

His complexion resembled a man who had just barely survived a great battle. In reality; not a drop of the blood was his. The quantity of mud that drenched him was not from being thrown into the swampy muck by the Gatorous, but rather a simple trip into the muck after he had felled the beast.

The townspeople now began to take notice. 
“It is Him! Soldier Mac, you have saved us again!”

As the sun set upon the town, the benevolent Mac was seated at the town square, as bouncing children and gossiping mothers gathered ‘round a great feast the fathers of the town had hunted for that morning.

People came up to the Hero and grasped his hand, he even let a young boy wield his sword. The crowds saw the man as cheerful as they ever had, and he had spoken no more than five words.

“The Beast has been felled”

The rejoicing of the night died away as Mac stood and walked from the Square. Such a rude and silent exit might well have been offensive if done so by any other Hero. Mac, however, was a special case. He was a silent, yet stoic, gentleman, who spoke only in the rarest of moments. The townspeople honored his silence and vowed to give him a massive, yet silent, funeral, should fate ever snatch away his beloved presence.

Mac was not silence for the sake of stoicism, but rather for the sake of sanity. His voice disgusted his ears, and his complexion disgusted his eyes. The look of himself in the mirrors revolted him, and every day he sought the sweetest relief of Death. The children glorified him, but he was no more than a coward. 

As he left the town that night, he wandered toward the woods. He stopped at a creek only to scrub his hair as well as the pathetic creek would allow. He wandered through darkness until he came across the large gash in the Earth that he had known so well. 

He traced the edge of the abyss until he came around it. He continued along the base of a rocky mount until a small hole revealed its presence in the moonlight. It was now that Mac extracted his lantern, and lit the wick inside. He entered the small opening in the rock, the lantern’s slight illuminative ability gave an eerie glow to Mac’s abode.

It was quite sad, the chest in the corner was empty; the only things Mac owned he generally kept on his person. For a bed, he had a pile of dried up grasses, perhaps some dried, gritty bits of mud mixed in. He pulled off his chest plate and leggings, and he threw them into the chest. 

He stripped away his filthy garments, and draped a new set of cloth over a clothing rack that was always empty. He had no efficient means of cleaning his clothes, he relied most on the garments given to him by grateful seamstresses and tailors.

He now climbed onto his so-called bed, and closed his eyes, already knowing what was to come…

**Mac opened his father’s door, and gazed inside the dim room. ”Father? Mother says breakfast is prepared.” He said nervously.**

**”Malcom, do not disturb me in my work!” His father snapped. The man, no smaller than six and a half feet, stood menacingly over Mac.**

**Mac knew better than to protest. He dropped his head submissively. “Sorry, Father.” I will not disturb you further.**

**”Go now.” His father said, waving his hand harshly at the boy.**

**Mac bowed his head slightly, and began to leave.**

**Where is your goddamned respect, boy?” His father growled.**

**”I respect you a lot, Father!” Mac began. “I would never purposefully disre-“**

**”You bow your head to your father the same way you do to a serf, and you dare to call me respected? You will be wise to respect me, boy!” His father stormed toward him, and Mac began to back away. He tripped over himself, slamming his back into the wall.**

**”Father, Please!” The boy screamed out as his father grabbed his throat. He knew now pleading would only worsen the beating that was to come.**

**He felt the first blows, but after being thrown and tossed his whole life, Mac knew how to separate himself from the pain.**

**The pain suddenly stopped repeating itself, the blows were no longer coming. Mac uncurled himself and was horrified. He could hear again, and all he knew was the sound of his mother choking, all he saw was the sight of his father, grasping her throat. Watching her legs swing and span as the muscles inside demanded oxygen, he was reminded of an animal as it convulsed immediately after death.**

**He charged his father, but the youngster had no power to stop what he was witnessing. He punch his father with ineffective attacks, and after a minute or so, his father dropped a limp body. Mac realized in a moment that his father’s rage was now turn into him.**

**He bolted. Running around his father, and into the kitchen, Mac grabbed his mot
