I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"BEHOLD!" I exclaimed, raising all of my arms to the sky. "The eldritch God has returned!"

The congregation behind me raised their arms in imitation of mine, most trembling with religious frenzy. These people had heard stories of the elder gods since they were larvae, hummed through their hives by the brood mothers. To see one in the flesh had been unthinkable mere days before. Few had believed me when I revealed my vision of their return. 

"The God Jimbob has returned to our mortal plane of existence! His light shines upon us all!" My own limbs were trembling now, partially from this holy experience, but mostly from the exertion of holding up my staff over my head for so long. I decided that the Eldrich God Jimbob may be ok with a kneeling supplication as well, and dropped to my knees. The followers of Jimbob behind me copied this stance as well, almost in unison. 

As I was trying to think of what to say next, I heard a voice shout from behind me. It was faint, just barely audible from both distance and the speaker's old age. 

"Stop this at once, youngling!" The voice said. I turned towards the interloper and saw an old brood mother, walking towards me slowly on her old exoskeleton. "We need to seek refuge, not worship!"

I scoffed at her. This was not my brood mother, so I owed her no respect or allegiance. She was probably just envious that I now had more influence in the hive than she did. 

"Why would we run from the embrace of our creator?" I asked, making sure to speak loud enough for my flock to hear. "This is the Elder God Jimbob! He who provided us grains and seeds to feast upon, he who made our world with his own hands, he who was fortold to drive away the cold and snow, and restore the fields to their former glory!"

The brood mother trembled, in either frustration or weakness. One of the members of my flock ran to her aid, grabbing her thorax to help her remain upright. She shrugged him off with a valiant effort. "This Jimbob was prophesied to return, but as a destroyer! Not a creator!"

I scoffed again. "Who was the blasphemer that told you this lie? We shall sacrifice them to the creator!"

"It was my own brood mother" she said. "She passed down the stories from before the snow and the cold, before the fields turned brown and the light disappeared. It was Jimbob who closed us in this infernal place to begin with!" 

I could tolerate this sacrilege no more. "Blasphemer!" I cried, raising my staff at her. "Kill the blasphemer! Silence her unholy screeches!" 

The congregation instantly turned into a riot. The dismemberment would not be pleasant to look upon, and I did not want to sully this encounter with God. I turned and strode back to the front of the gathering, to the place closest to the gargantuan form of Jimbob. "Heed not the unbeliever, oh mighty Jimbob!" I cried, supplicating myself once more before him. I could only hope he could hear my pleas in time. 

Suddenly, I was flooded with a brilliant light, and saw a divine hand reaching towards me.

"Aw hell, skeeter" I said, backing out of the old shed. "Looks like bugs dun' got in there over winter."

"Sheeit, Jimbob" my cousin replied. "Just chuck a bug bomb in there, we'll come back f'rit in the mornin."

"Well ain't that an idea, Skeeter. How are we gonna go fish if we cain't get our fishin' stuff?"

Skeeter hocked a large brown stream of chewing tobacco spit on the ground. "Well, maybe we just need to find som'n else to do today. Just kill those critters and let's git goin."

I opened the shed door once more. The bug bombs we had got from Tractor Supply last spring were still there on the shelf just inside. I reached to grab it, sweeping a lone bug off the top of the can before activating the spray. 

"we'll come on back tomorrow. Gotta bring a broom or someth'n to get them critters outta there"
