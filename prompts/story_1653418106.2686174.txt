STORY:
================================

Critiques welcome!

Richard “Dicks” Magee sat Amelia and Jon down at the abnormally long dining table with red velvet chairs. There was a stained glass window beside them, with yellowed nails slowly scraping up against it.

“I’m pretty sure vampires ate here,” Amelia said. She was about 13 and wore a turquoise shirt with a glittered heart in the middle.

Dicks Magee smiled, flashing one of his many silver teeth. “I’m sure vampires did eat here. When we go back to family court, tell mom I have the FUN HOUSE.” He clapped his hands against the mahogany table. “Anyway, what PROFITABLE ideas do we have next?”

This house was one of the most “profitable” houses that Dicks Magee had flipped in recent memory. It was unusually haunted. Like everywhere haunted. And Dicks Magee decided to profit. The blood from the bleeding walls was sold to a bloodbank. Ectoplasm? Glowstick factory. Large creepy rats? Now it was meat for the kids.

“C’mon kids, what should we do next?” Dicks Magee had a dyed-black combover with a white stripe in it, kind of like a skunk. 

Both Amelia and Jon stayed quiet for a while.

“Ghost dog petting zoo—“ Amelia asked before Jon shushed her.

“Don’t humor him.” Jon said. He wore punk band t-shirts, and Dicks Magee thought he was a smart-aleck. “What you’re doing is wrong.”

A bead of sweat appeared of Dicks Magee’s face. “What do you mean, wrong?”

Jon wrinkled his nose. “I saw the ghost family running an alterations shop in the basement? Do you actually think they want to interact with the material world like that? Don’t you think they want to be free?”

Dicks Magee huffed. “They agreed to work for me. I pay them for their work, and then they pay me rent.” The chandelier above Dicks Magee tinkled ominously.

Jon narrowed his eyes. “They shouldn’t have to pay you rent! They lived here originally!! If anything, YOU should pay them rent.” He got up from the table. “Let’s go, Amelia.”

Amelia sat uncomfortably at the table for five minutes while her father ranted about Jon’s insolence, how hard it was to be a small business owner, and how he had the right to charge rent at a house he bought fair and square. Finally, after what felt like eternity, Amelia feigned exhaustion and headed for bed.

Jon stood in the long, winding hallway, looking at the paintings of dead people he swore he saw blink. He felt bad for the ghost family downstairs. This ghost family, who had lived rent-free for so long, now forced to run an alterations shop just to keep living in THEIR home. He kept thinking about the ghosts, slaving days and days repairing intricate clothes they could never wear, receiving a paycheck of money that they couldn’t even spend. Except to pay rent to Dicks Magee.

Jon waited till everyone had fallen asleep. Finally, the whole house was silent, except for the hoarse, distant screams of the banshees in the attic. Jon braced himself. He knew what he had to do. He tiptoed to the basement, making sure not to turn on the light. He saw a shirt floating in the air, a needle going through it.

“It’s okay. You can show yourself to me. I’m a friend.”

Nothing happened. The shirt shuffled out of sight, and Jon seemed to be alone in the room, though he knew he was not alone.

“It’s okay. I’m not like him. I’m not like my father. I want to set you free.” Jon felt his face grow taut with feeling.

Suddenly, a little ghost revealed herself. She was a grey tinted mist with straw-colored hair and no eyes. The mother immediately shushed her and the ghost girl disappeared.

“What’s your name?” Jon got on his knees. “It’s okay.”

He stayed like that for several minutes with nothing happening. Finally, the father appeared, tall and gaunt grey mist. “What dooo you waaaant.” The voice was an echo.

“I want to set you free. From the sewing business.”

The father stared at him. “The person who owns this house gives us an impossible amount of garments, makes us work all hours of the day.”

“And it will never stop.” Jon said. “Unless my father is scared. Unless…you tried to…you know…take him out. Not like seriously, but just enough to scare him.”

The father made a fist. “Do not talk of violence around my daughter.”

Jon sighed. “I’m sorry. But how will you be free?”

The ghost mother appeared. She looked more hollow than the rest of them. “We won’t. This is our cross to bear.”

“There are other abandoned houses. A big one on Main Street.”

“It’s been so long since we left.” The father pointed his face at Jon.

“I’ll go with you.” Jon said.

They opened the door and walked together. The ghosts gasped when they saw a McDonalds or a gas station or a streetlight or the stars. They were not used to a Mississippi that looked like this.

“This is a world I do not recognize.” said the mother.

Finally, they found the old abandoned house. It was even older than the haunted house Dicks Magee had bought. Jon heard a choked sob.

“This is my grandmother’s house.” The ghost mother said. 

Before Jon could look up, the ghost family was i
