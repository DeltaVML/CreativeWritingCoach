STORY:

Only stammers escaped the expedition leader’s mouth. His fellows looked on, just as helpless.

“Wuh-wuh-wuh, what?!” The AI mocked him. Gathering his wits, the man projected a list of questions they had prepared for the Precursor’s Remains. He hadn’t risked a hazardous landing on this mediocre comet just to lose the knowledge of the ancients.

“I’m sorry. We just didn’t expect you to have such, personality? My name is Tom—”

“Tom? Spaceships and all behind you, and your name is Tom? Holy shit, we haven’t come far at all, have we?”

Tom fought back the stammers. “Great Remains of the Precursor, we have only come here seeking knowledge.”

“Well Tom, let’s get on with it. But stick to Jim for me, right? And yes, I can hear your hologram humming. No, I can’t see it. Ask away.”

“Ah, right. It’ll be a conversation, then. Erin, start recording.” A crewmember behind him went to work on a small laptop that folded out from a crate she carried with her. She gave a thumbs up.

“Great, first question. Precursor, sir, did your—”

“Jim is fine. Just Jim.”

Tom cleared his throat. He would rely on formalities to maintain his composure. 

“Jim, our first question will be the most important. Humanity has long searched for meaning and order. In the many ruins of their civilization, the Precursors hinted at some pattern, a code, some great Logic that the Universe itself subsists on. Truly, the Precursors must have used the logic to control this universe, to aid in their own proliferation. The torch has been passed to us, and now we petition you, Jim, the Great Remnant of the Precursors. Everything we’ve translated has indicated that -you- are the Logic that the universe runs on. We've sought you that we may act as the caretakers of this vast existence.”

The many lights on Jim’s sensors danced across his front panels for a moment, blending with the reflection of the millions of stars that the comet sped past. The cool glow of the system’s resident White Dwarf caught the visors of the crewmembers' suits as they eagerly awaited the wisdom they had journeyed so long for. Jim's sensors eventually stopped blinking. The lonely reflection of the galaxy was all that remained. Finally, the AI answered.

“Meaning? Order? What? Tom, the guy they based me on died of cancer. Look around you. This is all there is. All there ever was."
