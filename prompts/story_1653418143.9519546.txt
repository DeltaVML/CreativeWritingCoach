STORY:

Excerpts from the diary of the President of the first contact committee, 2042


March 22nd

The team of physicists had found a variation in their studies, a wormhole for the lack of a better word 3 months ago.
Further research led them to this
The multiverse was proven 
And the world hasn't been the same since

The initial size of the wormhole meant we could only exchange tiny pieces of information with each other
The language barrier did not take long to break thanks to our advanced AI

But what they told us about their universe left us in utter shock

THEY FOUND MIDDLE EARTH!!!

These people had Magic!

Every child's dream. Every adults dream if I'm being honest

The news has been in a frenzy

Today I was officially appointed to lead the committee for first contact

It will be my greatest honor!


April 4th

The team is working tirelessly to find ways to make the wormhole larger, more travel friendly.

I'm proud of these guys

My little nerds working away, dying to meet the wizards.

But my office has been inundated with requests from various other departments.  I guess everyone wants to meet the wizards.


April 17th.

I had to handle a minor riot outside my office

The geologists had staged a sit in

"These guys probably have magic rocks! I mean, we love normal rocks.......imagine how much we would love to study frigging magic rocks!" Squealed the head of their department. 
I mean when a man close to 60 tells you he wants to meet the wizards to discuss magic rocks, you can't really say anything, right?


April 20th

My office is in utter chaos

The dean of medicine showed up today. She was a scary woman at the best of times and she demanded that for the betterment of humanity, the doctors needed to meet the wizards first

Yesterday it was the engineers, who came in with a whole PowerPoint to explain why they needed to meet the wizards first

The chemistry guys have been on our asses since day one, anyway.

I have to sort this out.



April 25th

It's done
I spoke to the admin, and we have designed a committee with all the major departments having representatives during the first meeting


I just hope none of these idiots embarrass the rest of us with their over enthusiasm 










The following is the account of a post doc candidate from the initial discovery team on the day of the first contact. The essay was published on his personal blog on 7th May 2042



The day started like any other. And yet we all knew, that any day after this would never be the same.

All of us gathered in the giant conference room ready for first contact

In the end there were roughly 50 of us there
The main research team were all allowed. Of course we were. We made this possible
3 or 4 representatives of the higher ups
Representatives of about 10 science departments 

The air was filled with excitement,  yet no one really spoke out loud 

The wormhole was finally opened and we saw on the other side........ EARTH 2.0

The president walked over and exchanged pleasantries with the head of their group, the grand mage.

He welcomed them in and gave some quick introductions.

The room was suddenly abuzz with excitement 


Much like us the wizards were in groups as well. We knew that already. During the phase of communication, we had learned that wizards (which is gender neutral, btw) usually specialized in some special type of magic, just like in our academia.



Just after the introductions, there was a moment of awkward silence

And then one of the healers spoke out "is it true that you people have figured out a way to stop and re start the heart?"

The dean of medicine, who's specialization was actually anesthesiology looked taken aback for a second,  but quickly recovered and smiled brightly. It was her moment

"Yes!!" She said. "We call it cardioplegia. Usually done for heart surgeries. The patients heart is stopped temporarily and the blood is made to run through a system outside that keeps it pumping."
She was about to continue, but looked a little embarrassed on realizing that the entire room was paying attention to her.

The wizards however looked super impressed. 

The healers and necromancers crowded around her to ask further questions.




The head of geology, who was barely holding it together blurted " is the philosophers stone real? Please tell me it is?" To the alchemists

"Aye, replied one the alchemists.  But it's unfortunately lost to history. During the great war" 

"Woah. Really? Tell me more!"

"You guys can talk to each other through great distances?"

"You guys can cast spells to make fireballs?"

"Wait, are you telling me you can make drawings dance? That wasn't a joke. Show me this movies you talked of"

Very soon, the wizards and the science nerds were grouped off and were excitedly discussing their respective fields.

I hung back, taking in the beauty of this wonderful meeting.

The necromancers were convinced anaesthsia was the same as death and were demanding that the doctors
