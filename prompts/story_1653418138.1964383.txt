I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"You remember that woman who could control water right? The one who accidentally drowned that puppy during that warehouse fire in the industrial park? Right? Well I got her working in the sewers, clears a fatburg in seconds. Saves the council thousands of quid every day. No more dealing with the public, not that they're keen on her anymore. Did you see the tabloids after that whole debacle? Nice girl as well" 

He tried to feign interest at the young, highly animated man across the desk monologuing in his direction. He had always been the one monologuing in his last role. Surely his hadn't been this self indulgent though? 

"That's not really, the sort of role I want... I've not killed anyone, the wife just wants me doing something with regular hours, regular pay, that sort of thing"

"The sewers wasn't a punishment though was it? Look you can't go from bloody superman to Greggs can you? You need to be out the public eye or there's no point transferring. Now how fast could you fly? If you can go fast enough luxury courier is a nice little earner"

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
