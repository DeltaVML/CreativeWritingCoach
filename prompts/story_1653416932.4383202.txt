STORY:
================================

“Why are you here? You don’t even care for the royalty, just leave us be. We don’t want to hurt you.”

 

“Hurt me? What, with that blunt bread knife you call a dagger? Here, I’ll give you one of my daggers. I want this to at least be entertaining.” Galden removed his dagger from his leather pouch, tossing the blade towards the feet of the kidnapper. The dagger landed tip down, digging itself into the floor.

 

“Wh-what? You think this is a joke? There are three of us and one of you. How are you going to kill us all? Huh? I bet you’re just bluffing, that’s all.” The main kidnapper, Mavin, glanced at the dagger near his feet before eyeing the dull edges of his weapon.

 

“Three of you and not a single piece of protective armor between you. How do you expect to pierce a helmet or chest plate with that? Pick up the weapon and show me an actual fight. If you won’t, I suggest you get out of my way. The reward for the princess is enough to fuel my drinks for the next year.”

 

“That’s all you care about? Have you no pride, sir knight? You are meant to be a glimmer of hope.”

 

“You expect me to work for free? Like those little peasants that toil away in the farmlands only to die from whatever rotten disease plagues our kingdom? I’m a knight. Nothing honorable about serving a king. Are we fighting or not? Last chance to decide.”

 

Marvin looked at his two accomplices. Brandon gave a confident nod, even while his small body shook, unable to hide his nerves. Trisha took a step forward, circling around the knight, preparing to get behind him when the battle took place. With the two having prepared for their fates, Marvin went to reach for the dagger, only to get startled by a scream.

 

“DON’T TOUCH THAT! HE WILL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF AS SOON AS YOU BEND DOWN.”

 

When Marvin pulled his head away, he would see the sword of the knight hovering overhead. Had he kept his head down any longer, it would be rolling on the floor by his feet. Trisha had tried to stop the attack, but her blade had only dented the back armor of the knight, unable to cut through. Galden returned his blade to its sheath, raising a hand towards Trisha, warning her to halt from any further attacks.

“Princess? I don’t approve of you warning your kidnappers about my attack. If I didn’t know any better, I would think you were hoping I would die in this encounter.” 
“I knew you wouldn’t die. Steel plate armor like yours can sustain such attacks. I was just hoping they might have given you a few knocks over your head before I needed to reveal myself.” She gave a mocking curtsy to Galden, collecting the dagger as she did.

 

“Come on, I don’t know what this is and I don’t care. Even if you got yourself kidnapped on purpose, it hardly matters. I have a job to do, so you can either come along quietly or I’ll drag you back over my shoulder. If you pick the second choice, I will smack you against every tree branch on the way home.”

 

“You will do no such thing to our lady.” Trisha said, stepping forward, only for Galden to look back in her direction, squinting at her through the eyehole in his helmet.

 

“Your lady? What sort of kidnappers are you people? Ok, what’s going on princess? You haven’t got a scratch on you, so it’s clear that you planned this. I’m just curious as to why. Is this some sort of royal tamper tantrum?” Galden heard a heavy step, glancing Trisha’s way. “You try anything, and I will kill you.”

 

“Trisha, it’s ok. For his many faults, Galden has been decent to me. He isn’t part of the ploy to kill me. Not even those that lurk in the castle’s shadows would trust him enough for a job like that. Isn’t that right, the disgrace of Feldindall?”

 

“Disgrace? It’s rich calling me a disgrace when your daddy sends me to do his dirty work. Are you forgetting who watched over you, brat?”

 

“Not at all. Which is why I am giving you a chance to do something right for once. There’s a cult after me, one hiding in the castle’s walls.”

 

“Ah, huh? There’s always a cult, princess. Cults are a common part of life. I’ve killed hundreds of cult members. They are just going to be a threat that you must get used to. Come on, let’s go.”

 

“You don’t understand. These cults aren’t like the others. They have members with these weird glowing blue eyes. I saw one roaming the halls at night. It would have spotted me if I didn’t dive underneath the dining table.” Brandon said, grabbing the arm of Galden, only to receive a hard smack across the face for it. Galden’s gauntlet connecting with his cheek, sending him to the floor.

  
“And what were you doing near the dining table?” Galden went to grab his sword, only for Trisha and Marvin to step forward, blocking his access to the downed man. “You’re protecting a thief.”

 

“Former thief. He was the one that convinced the others to warn me about the plan.” Alisa stepped forward, pulling up the sleeve of her long, flowing white dress before she smacked the side of his helmet with his dagger’s handle, s
