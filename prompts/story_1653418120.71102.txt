STORY:
================================

"Just tossing around stuff is boring," the girl said. "My mom said this would be fun!"

"Do you want to summon some butterflies again? That was really cool!" I responded.

"No, but what if I turn you into a butterfly. You are always talking about the clouds, you could visit them." Suddenly I was engulfed in a bright flash. My body started to melt and I felt it shrink. Something grew on my back. I waited for my partner to complete the plan.

"Turn her back," my partner said calmly. "Somebody is going to accidentally hurt her!" Again I transformed. But when I was back to my old size, I noticed my skin was dark and thick like leather. "Nobody is going to hurt you now," the girl smiled at me. I could scold her now, but how would she respond. She had unbelievable powers. We have seen amazing powers before, but nothing like this.

"Can you make people do things?" I asked to distract her from the situation.

"Like, I could make you bark like a dog?" I nodded. If she could also force actions, we were in serious trouble. At least, she did not seem to have any mind-reading powers.

"Of course, I can do this!" And she snapped her fingers. Suddenly, my mouth barked. I tried to tell her to undo this, but I kept barking uncontrollably. I looked at my partner. He should have done it by now. "Wow, that is crazy!" he responded. That wasn't our plan. I looked at him, barking my soul out. DO IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. I WILL BE FINE.

"What do you want her to do now?" she asked him. She seemed to enjoy this a lot. "What about you make her act like a plane. You loved to do this." I wanted to yell, but I could only bark. Well, until she curled her pinky. Then my arms spread out and I couldn't stop making engine sounds as I ran aimlessly around the room. DO IT!

"Well, I think the plane needs to refuel now. Unfortunately, the cantina is still closed, I'll bring the food to your room again."

"Oh, I am so hungry right now!" The girl made a simple gesture, and my mind was freed. My partner left the room. What on earth was he thinking! I noticed something grab my arm. "You don't really want this skin, do you?"

"I liked my old one better, this does not really fit my style," I tried with an honest answer. And thankfully, she didn't rage and swiftly returned me to my old style. She fold her hands and I noticed a bright light inside. When she opened her hands, there was a shiny golden ring. She handed it to me.

"If you ever get into trouble, just put it on. Then you can make them bark as well." I thanked her for the gift and went into the meeting room, where my partner awaited me.

"I TOLD YOU TO F\*CKING BLOW HER BRAIN OUT THE SECOND SHE USED HER POWER ON ME IN A DISTURBING WAY! Ok, screw the butterfly, but when she fucking made me bark, why didn't you pull the trigger? This girl is too dangerous to be left alive!"

"Amy, I gave my best, but every time I tried to reach for my gun, my arm stopped responding. Like my nerves were severed. I also tried to trigger the fire alert so the gas of the dry sprinkler system would knock her out. But again, I could not press the button."

"A fucking protective aura!" I exclaimed. "We need to find a way to bypass it. She has just given me this ring and said it could control minds. Imagine this ring in the hands of a dictator! And she just made this in seconds. What if she turns somebody into a god?"

"Well, I'll put actual chloroform into her room this time. You distract her again. We need to keep her happy at all costs until we found a way to neutralize her."

"I am not going to endure getting turned into a remote-controlled monster again. It's your turn now. You failed, and now I am the assassin."

He laughed. "Make me do it! I am the higher rank, so you do the dirty jobs. The boss will order you to do it if I ask him."

Without skipping a beat I put on her ring. Instantly, the ring started to emit black flames. "You will tell the boss that you volunteer!" I spoke. His eyes turned as black as the flames.

"Anything you want, milady!"
