STORY:

XX/XX/3499

Message Sent By: Dr. Xander Starthorne of New Earth  
Message Recipient: Galactic Centre of Defense and Law

I am writing to you today to discuss a serious matter, and to make a plea.

There's an Old Earth phrase that goes something like; 'If you give enough monkeys a typewriter, eventually one will come up with the works of Shake-Spear.'

I never understood what that meant, especially not when I first came across it. I knew what monkeys and typewriters were obviously - hardly a combination that would result in anything coherent. Whoever or whatever this 'Shake-Spear' was, they must have been quite prominent in Old Earth culture to be noted in this manner. For this reason, I believe the phrase is an analogy for effort. If you work at something hard enough, regardless of following proper protocol, eventually you'll get the result you worked to achieve.

In any other circumstance, I would be embarrassed to admit that it was only *after* two very recent incidents that I came to that conclusion.

I met many of you during last year's Galactica Ball. I was called 'very intelligent for a human,' and I'm sure I talked many ears off about chaos theory and quantum mechanics before I was called away to dance.

I admit to not remembering much after that - only waking up the next morning with a massive headache and an armed bomb. 

As I am sure you are aware, humans generally have an *interesting* history with alcohol. Unlike extraterrestrial lifeforms like myself, humans tend to undergo intoxication - or in layman's terms, *get drunk* \- when consuming too much. Humans undergo a series of symptoms during this time, including but not limited to; lowered inhibition and intelligence, heightened emotional state and nausea.

So, you would imagine that a human wouldn't be able to make a bomb, much less a working one, much less one that would cause destruction of this scale while intoxicated...and yet I somehow accomplished the task! I would be proud of my achievement if I remembered how it came about. Try as I may, I cannot recall how I did it.

I am aware that there were reservations about taking disciplinary action aside from confiscating the bomb - I will admit here that in my previous shame, I asked my friend Zurek to contact you, and they spoke with Major Callin on the matter.

"A mind as brilliant as Dr. Starthorne's could be useful to us," he had told them. I concede that this is true; with the demands that come with modern intergalactic life, brilliant minds are always sorely needed. 

However, I got intoxicated again at last week's Interplanetary Entertainment Awards afterparty, and the next day news of the Time Unwinder reached the homepage.  As if the bomb had not been concerning enough, but an instrument capable of distorting the flow of time using only *sound?* I'd have not believed it myself until I got the courage to test it; I made one small note and invited chaos into my lab in the form of a pack of velociraptors! 

Even more unsettling that I also do not recall how I created it, I made it to look like a regular flute! If one note was enough to summon a pack of velociraptors, what would happen if someone were to play a whole aria?

Now, to get to the point. It is for the aforementioned two reasons - the Absolute Zero Bomb and the Time Unraveler - that I *implore* you to ban me from any and all gatherings moving forward. Do whatever you have to do to make it happen! I shudder to think of what I might accidentally create next, and I fear it will only be a matter of time before someone takes the devices I create and uses them.

Fondest regards;  
Dr. Xander Starthorne

PS: Attached please find the compensation check for the velociraptor incident.

**\[After a week, Xander would see that the Centre had released a new law - one that banned anyone that had made more than one doomsday device from any and all social gatherings - and would feel a weight lifted from his shoulders.\]**
