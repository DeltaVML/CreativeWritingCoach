I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The sun, honestly, could stand to rise a lot faster.

Its slow, lazy ascent, after a full night’s sleep, meant that the spirits in our house retreated—but ever so reluctantly. I pulled myself out from the couch, having caught about two winks the whole night. Bleary eyes blinked at the sudden brightness, feeling searing instead of soothing.

“Baby,” a voice said from my stairs. “I don’t think I can do this much longer.”

If there was no light outside the windows, I might have suspected they came from the spirits. But surprisingly, they have been rather respectful of boundaries. So I turned to see my wife The look April reserved for me might once have been loving, but the dark eye circles have superseded any sort of emotion like a blackout curtain.

“Is this really worth it? I’ve not had a proper night’s sleep for months.”

I yawned.

“When was the last time you slept properly while you were slaving away at your corporate desk?”

“... Fair point,” she yawned as well, sidling up onto the couch. “Did you find what you were looking for?”

“Yea,” I said, pointing towards the TV with the static screen flickering. “I got quite a bit of long, black hair. A few more nights out here, and I’ll probably be able to get enough for a substantial order of wigs. You?”

“That’s good,” April said, absent-mindedly playing with her own frazzled hair. “I think the monsters under the bed caught on. They don’t really fall for the mannequin feet any longer.”

“No matter,” I mumbled. “They weren’t really very harvestable.”

“I agree,” my wife sighed. “Besides the odd horns we could pass off as some exotic animal’s.”

“Is there anything else we can do?”

“I haven’t had breakfast,” April moaned, flopping backwards onto the rest of the couch. “Can we literally do anything else but brainstorm?”

“We are going to crash again right after this, no matter how unfulfilling it feels,” I said, taking her hand into mine. “Just a few more ideas. Please.”

“I cannot wait to move out of this house,” she grumbled.

“We will, when we can throw all the money we earn into a nice passive investment,” I said. “We’ll go on a honeymoon. I swear. But you’re the creative one, babe..”

“Fine,” she said, puffing her breath out. “Gargoyles. Maybe we can use some of their stone, for some sort of homeopathic treatments. It’s surprisingly shiny.”

“They are quite shiny,” I said, glancing at the two that perched over our doorway. “I think it might work. I’ll get the toolbox later.”

April said, stifling another yawn. “Oh, and the Ouija boards that move by themselves? I was thinking we could set up cameras beside them for some sort of chill horror stream.”

“That sounds paradoxical.”

“That is my life,” April said. “You never know what the internet is into.”

“Valid,” I said. “I can grab the cameras, I think. Prepare some spooky music as well.”

“I’ll choose the music. You are terrible at it. I’ll even put some mics in the corners for some tasteful banshee screams.”

“I wish I had the energy to argue,” I conceded, rubbing my growling stomach. “But those are great, thanks. What’s for breakfast?”

“Oh, thank heavens,” April slid down onto the couch, curling her legs and arms towards her, eyes slowly shuttering. “I think there’s some sort of cured demon… few days ago…”

I patted her on the head, and put a blanket over her. I peered at the fridge, and contemplated between this and just heading out to get greasy fast food breakfast.

Ah, well. Anything to save a bit of money. I’ll treat myself during the honeymoon.

“Screw it,” I said. “I’m so hungry, I  could eat a whole monster.”
