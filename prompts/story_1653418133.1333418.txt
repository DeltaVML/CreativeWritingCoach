STORY:
================================

“Alright, just one though alright robin?”- “right, just one pet thats all, nothing more….” Robin slowly gazed his eyes towards his friend on the ship as his hands rapidly started shaking. No one has ever touched an alien before, he’s going to history this time, and then get a pizza later, “just one, right?” His friend confirmed as Robin gained speed reaching out in some sort of, out of mind zeal at touching a non-human, “Robin…what are you doing”. 

At this point Robin grasped his hand around his friends face, smoothing it, and running his fingers across the skin, he couldnt enough, after all…theres nothing wrong with this “ok Robin, tahst enough. Let go”… “no no no, just a- a few more seconds….that all i need”
“Ok. 3 more seconds.”

Once Robins hand was off, his body felt. Angry, enraged even. Why cant he do it more? Why is there this stupid rule preventing this, but as he lost control of himself to reach for another touch he was interrupted. “Robin…look at your hand.”

Gazing down at his hand, it started to bubble, as if he was highly reactant to an insect sting his hand lit a smooth red and white, bubbling and bursting instantly, then the burst turned like acid, which with what it does turns every cell into nothing but liquid basically, smoke arising from the hand as it descents into red and black streaks running up his arm “bobby…whats happening to me?”
His friend backed up into the wall, not wanting to get any closer. “Bobby?! Help”
Before his friend could rach for him, Robin was already gone.
