STORY:
================================

"Omg its so cute!" 

Riya squealed as she looking into the enclosure housing a mutated otter. She was the newest part timer and went to the same university as me, and with the uptick in sales professor Wrightsmith decided to hire a few more employees to take the load off of me. As Riya pressed her face to the glass, the mutated otter waved to her, using its front paws, or well hands, as the good professor had crossed the little guy with a monkey of some kind, probably in an effort to make a tiny aquatic minion, but the end result was a so-ugly-its-cute pet that flew off the shelves so to speak. 

"Isn't he just adorable Martin?" She asked and I replied half heartedly with a "Yeah"

She had stuck her finger in the try and pet it now, and it had obliged her, this particular furry menace was named archer, and loved to get attention from everyone except me, as he'd tried to bite me when I tried that exact same thing. 

After petting half of our stock, and showing her how to clean and feed the miniature zoo we housed along the back wall, we returned to the register. The third employee on shift, and perhaps the only other one that spent more time here than me, was Jack. Now, jack was strange by most people's standards, but that might have been because he was a cat, a talking cat, and I couldn't figure out if he'd been a regular cat that the professor changed... somehow to make him talk, or if he'd been a person that got changed into a cat. Either way, he embraced his feline identity wholeheartedly, grooming himself at the register while we walked back behind the counter. 

"There you two are, it happened again while you two were occupied with archer..." 

The *it* jack was talking about, was an increasingly common occurrence these days, professor Wrightsmith had a hard time keeping part timers, either due to injury, quiting, or disappearance, we seemed to have a rotating staff of college students and drifters. Another part timer had quite, and by the nametag I saw on the counter, I owed jack a few cat treats. 

"I would have sworn Susan was going to last longer than a month." I said as I reached up towards the shelf I kept the treats on behind us. 

"You may have been right, if she hadn't gotten that weird concoction of professor Wrightsmith's on her. She started acting differently after that, more self assured." 

Self assured was a word for it, in truth, Susan had been a sweet, but shy girl, two years younger than me, with thick rimmed glasses and a curly mane of brown hair. After *the spill* she'd been much more aggressive with what she wanted and how she went about doing things. She'd ditched the glasses, started dressing up in things other than jeans and a hoodie, and starting wearing make up, all of which was unusual for her, but I figured she wanted to change things up. I got a little concerned when she changed her major from chemistry, to marketing, the very next day. This from the girl who'd been terrified to speak with customers one on one, now had very little trouble with public speaking. Good for her, I was gonna miss her though. 

I'd been on autopilot for awhile when the good professor burst onto the store floor with a shout of "by Jove, I've got it!" 

He was a middle aged man, with a very posh accent, that I couldn't decide if it was natural or faked. He usually wore tweed suits, a monocle and had an admittedly majestic mustache, his prized possession among all of his creations. 

His sudden entrance had startled Riya who'd dropped a container of something labeled Dr. Wrightsmith's invigorating elixir, a bubbly green concoction that glinted in the light. She fumbled with the glass container for a second before catching it with her foot. I breathed a sign of relief as she'd taken my warning about spilling the chemicals here to heart and made every effort to prevent it, and I had silently been thankful she was quite athletic. 

"Good show!" The professor said, having watched her juggle his potentially hazardous brew, from the counter he know leaned on, and that I had lept over to try and help her. I'd only made it half way before she'd saved it, and I don't know what I would have done to help, but a smile from riya to the both of us and a gesture with her hand towards her foot. "And my dad said sports was a waste of time." 

After that averted disaster, Riya joined me by the counter and we both leaned in to listen to what the professor had burst down here to say, he rarely left his offices above the ground floor, but when he did, it was when he'd finished a creation. Jack was off taking a nap, as he found the whole thing beneath him, and didn't budge from the cat tower I'd built him near the front window to catch the sun's afternoon rays. 

"I've done it, I've created a way to revolutionize the way we get deliveries!" Taking both of us by the wrist he drug us into his laboratory. Past his numerous creations, beakers of chemicals, and who knows what sort of mechanical contraptions, all the way to the
