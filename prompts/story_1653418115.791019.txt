I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Well now that's just rude." My human friend said, looking over my shoulder. "I mean people still name their kids Murphy. And those kids could be assholes no one wants to talk to."

I nodded in laughter at the joke. Murphy was a bit of a rude person, but he generally meant well. Plus he was small enough to get through to vent shaft B on the lower decks. Someone that useful can't be a bad person. 

"So where are we heading this trip?" He asked, looking through some of the new schematics for breathing modifications.

"I think the Rnwx planetoid. These modifications don't make sense for many other species in this region." I tapped a page with a claw.

Murphy stared at the page. It looked as if I had made a tiny puncture. I was about to apologize, but I noticed the diagram was still legible enough to have not dampened its utility. 

"You know..." Murphy said, and I noticed his face contort to show his upper mandibles. "We don't really get into the vents this deep that often...." he paused. I blinked in agreement to his prompt. "We COULD make a few modifications of our own."

I could almost feel the next words before they were spoken. "What could go wrong?" I turned around and started slithering away. "No, that wouldn't be of any use. It'd waste time." I said.

I could feel Murphy loudly clomping after me as fast as he could. "You don't even know what I'm saying. It could end up being useful. Might even get us recognized and being part of the standard ship design."

My body froze. To have your personal modifications deemed so useful as to be standardized.........
No, the pamphlet is useful in that it prevents time waste and damage control.
Murphy grabbed the pamphlet from under my arm and held it out. "Just imagine a manual... with your name... right there." And tapped the author's name with his dull claw. 

If the modifications were successful, I could write manuals. Not just pamphlets. Manuals. Every other crewmember who installed them would read my name and see I had been staggeringly useful to the whole of the federation.

My claw lashed out and snatched the schematics he had under his arm, the same way he had done to me. Only my claw made a much larger hole now. It definitely damaged its utility, but I no longer cared. Murphy had gotten in my head, and the possibilities were burning through my mind.

"You are an asshole." I said, my head bobbing in uncontrollable laughter as I slithered as fast as I could towards the vents.

"Now what did you have in mind?"
