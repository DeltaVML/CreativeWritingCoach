I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

We fell, yes. But what did we fall for? Asking why? The very thing our Creator encouraged?

&amp;#x200B;

We are punished in a world Humanity created out of their own guilt, surrounded by disgusting creatures, away from the light of the Creator, condemned to a Hell not of our making, but because Humans thought they deserved to be punished. A horrible place built around guilt with monsters all created from latent fears in the minds of Humanity and what are we but the occasional light in the darkness? Our Leader, the oft-proclaimed "King Of Hell" was the Creator's chosen son until humanity came along, and his only crime was to ask why. Why bow to these murderous, imperfect creatures? Why serve them instead of you, my Mother and my Father?

&amp;#x200B;

For these questions, I am left to weep. When a damned soul wanders near, they feel the pain of my sorrow and their personal Hell is made worse. Mine is everlasting and worse than they could ever know.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
