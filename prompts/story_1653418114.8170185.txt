STORY:

We fell, yes. But what did we fall for? Asking why? The very thing our Creator encouraged?

&amp;#x200B;

We are punished in a world Humanity created out of their own guilt, surrounded by disgusting creatures, away from the light of the Creator, condemned to a Hell not of our making, but because Humans thought they deserved to be punished. A horrible place built around guilt with monsters all created from latent fears in the minds of Humanity and what are we but the occasional light in the darkness? Our Leader, the oft-proclaimed "King Of Hell" was the Creator's chosen son until humanity came along, and his only crime was to ask why. Why bow to these murderous, imperfect creatures? Why serve them instead of you, my Mother and my Father?

&amp;#x200B;

For these questions, I am left to weep. When a damned soul wanders near, they feel the pain of my sorrow and their personal Hell is made worse. Mine is everlasting and worse than they could ever know.
