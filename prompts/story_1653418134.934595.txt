I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Did you hear that?" Circe sat up.  
"No? What is it?" As always Medusa was wary of the unexpected.  
"Footsteps," Circe turned her head, trying to discern the origin of the noise. The echoes were so very faint, "I think someone's coming from down there." She pointed down one of the dark halls of the ruins the couple had made their home.  
A moment passed in silence before Medusa too seemed to hear the falls bouncing off the high ceilings. In a hushed voice Medusa said, "Stay quiet, I'll help you hide." She embraced Circe and with a few beats of her wings they lifted off.   
By now Circe felt safer flying with Medusa than walking on her own, but although she made not a single sound, by the time they landed, she had no sense if they were perched somewhere high above the floor or by one of the many toppled pillars.  
"I need you to stay here," Medusa kissed her forehead, "promise?"  
"I promise."  
The sound of powerful wings disappeared into the eternal darkness that surrounded Circe, and she could do little but wait.

The steps got louder. For a while it was the only sound she heard, the echoes swallowing her world. And then, nothing. Something moved. It sounded like Medusa.  
"Who's there?" Medusa's voice was as commanding and terrifying as it had been on the day they met. It was a voice she reserved entirely for scaring away strangers. "Show yourself, phantom!"  
Circe could hear her moving through the vault. Searching. A rock hit the floor in one corner, Medusa would follow, the *scuff* of leather was heard somewhere else, and once again she reacted, investigating. But it was the *twang* of steel that made Circe jolt.

Circe heard Medusa hiss, *Is she attacking?* A loud *thump* followed and then ...utter quiet.  
It felt like forever before Circe built up the courage to call for her. "Medusa? Are you there?" She called in a dread voice more timid than she'd intended, and with that the steps filled the room again. This time they were running, they were running away, disappearing into nothingness.

With a shaking voice, she managed only two more words: 

"My love?"
