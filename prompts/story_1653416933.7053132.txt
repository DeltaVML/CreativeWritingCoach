I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I cringed when my friend started shouting out the summoning, damn I didn't realise Dave was a warlock. I looked at the burning town which we'd been gleefully plundering and the paladins that had just arrived standing across from Dave. I'd never live this down, ugh Dad was going to be insufferable "this one time I even had to save him from four measly paladins!" I could see it already, every family function, dad would never let me forget. NO, no I couldn't let this happen, with a decisive nod I lifted my hand and threw a dimensional banishing at Dave, let him have a chat with Dad in the outer void. 

I sighed and turned towards the paladins. "I'd love to toy with you guys, but I have three minutes and I need to make this as horrific as possible" I said as I shed my fleshy shell, eldritch power exploding outwards.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
