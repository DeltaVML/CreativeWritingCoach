I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

When I'm nineteen, a new program is started called the Timeline Adjustment. I signed up for it, even knowing that it might be years before it became a viable program. Then I lucked out, the beta testing of it becomes available when I'm twenty-three. 

There's risks to it. So many risks. I might not land in the past where I am supposed to. I might not survive the time shift. My body might not reform right. There's a chance meeting myself in the past will unmake both of us. There's countless other dangers that they listed and I either listened to or ignored. It doesn't matter. I have to try. 

My family died when I was three, I grew up in a series of foster homes and orphanages. No matter how hard I tried, I never managed to connect with anyone or settle into a home. I didn't belong. 

When I heard of the project, it was a chance to change my life, to give the child I was a home and family. 

If I manage to live to the point where there would be three versions of me, the one that traveled into the past will vanish. Exactly one minute after I travel into the past, I will solidify once more, with all my memories intact, the exact age I was when I left. I'm not sure how well  I will adjust to being twenty-three with the memories of someone who is forty-three. I'll deal with that when it happens. If it happens. As another possibility is that my forty-three year old self will remain, while my younger self will both travel back and stay at the exact same time. A third possibility is by traveling back they have created a new timeline, where I didn't travel in the past, as a different world's version is here instead. 

It doesn't matter. I *have* to do this. If there is even a small chance of success, that I can make sure younger me doesn't have to deal with the loneliness and heartbreak of being alone it will be worth it.
