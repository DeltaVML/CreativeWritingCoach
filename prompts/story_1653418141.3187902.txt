STORY:
================================

Veila grinned as the latch made a satisfying click, it was unlocked.
  

  
Opening the window at a pace that would make sloths impatient, she crept into the palace. The prince hadn’t been seen for weeks now, so she anticipated it would be safe to sneak into his room, but it never hurts to be cautious.
  

  
She took a moment to look around at the room of the man she was supposed to marry, finding a familiar book on the mantle. It was the Pirate Prince, a tale about a prince who left his royal palace to become a pirate. Veila was always inspired by the Pirate Prince’s free spirit. How he could leave everything behind without worrying what dangers lie ahead, instead inviting them to find him. By running away from her home, she had finally made that leap, inspired by the Pirate Prince. Could the prince she was to marry have done the same, inspired by the same book?
  

  
Veila shook her head, it was wishful thinking. She would not be married off, to have her life arranged for her. She would make her own path, love who she wished, and have the future she desired. Besides, it was too late now. She was a wanted criminal, and while her crimes could perhaps be excused with enough royal funds, this next score would change all that. She had been hired to steal a precious artifact from the palace of the neighboring kingdom she was to be married off to.
  

  
The princess-turned-thief was about to leave the room when she noticed an open diary on the prince’s bed. Before she had a chance to look away a passage caught her eye, the final entry. It read: “Today I am running away. It seems foolish, I know. Giving up my life as prince for adventure. So many are envious of my position, yet I find it increasingly restricting. I never want for anything, which leads me to want for everything. Freedom. Freedom to make my own decisions, my own mistakes, to struggle and carve out my own path. I have been studying the area and civilian culture extensively of late and can protect myself with my keen fencing skills. I’ll be just like the Pirate Prince! I will miss my family and my servants, but I cannot see myself living a sham marriage in a false life. I fear this will be my last entry.”
  

  
Then Veila had an idea. It was a foolish idea. A terrible, useless, idiotic idea. But the prince wasn’t around to write in it and surely his family wouldn’t want to read that last entry, so she figured, perhaps, it would be best with her. That night, along with the artifact, Veila stole the prince’s diary.
  

  
What was perhaps more foolish than stealing the prince’s diary, was reading it. They were the private thoughts of a man she had never met, but the more she read, the more she felt as if she knew him. She found herself daydreaming during heists, which, despite being terribly dangerous, was also terribly foolish. What use would it be? The prince had already run away, she would never find him now.
  

  
Though, the princess believed all was not lost. With what she read of the prince’s diary, she was beginning to understand how he thought quite well. He was a dreamer, like her. One who grew up on fairy tales and hope. More than that, they both held a belief that they could make those dreams a reality if they put their mind to it. There was one dream the prince had that Veila herself shared: to be the Pirate Prince.
  

  
Though unlike Veila, he actually was a prince. If he actually made his dream a reality, then he would have found a ship with red sails, made of polished royalwood, the front of the ship adorned with a crowned queen, representing the life left behind, and the name of the ship would be: The Inheritance. But a ship with all those features would be nearly impossible to acquire with a runaway’s resources.
  

  
Besides, if he was at sea, she would most likely never run into him. For a time she set aside her dream of finding him, though every now and again her thoughts would still wander to the prince. Imagining him captaining his own ship, a grin on his face and the wind in his hair, his dream fulfilled.
  

  
As time drew on the search for the princess by her family became more ardent, and soon it was no longer safe to stay in the kingdom. She found passage on a ship heading to the next kingdom, saying goodbye to her old roots.
  

  
While the trip was mostly uneventful, a day before they were about to reach shore they were intercepted by another ship. Once with red sails, of polished royalwood, a crowned queen at its bow, and, was named in bold print: The Inheritance.
