STORY:
================================

“It seems like your sentence is almost up Logan,” said Brady.

“Would you look at that, replied Logan, I guess it is.“

“What are you going to do when you get out?” asked Brady.

“The first thing I’m going to do is to put all my meditation practice into effect. I am going to talk to people nice. I am going to  treat people right. I do not ever want to return to this pit. And then I am going to carve my teeth into the meatiest juiciest cheeseburger I can find.”

The two cellmates filled the empty room with laughter from the heart. Although Brady had only known Logan for a few months they had become dependent on one another’s talents and skills. Brady was a tattoo artist on the outside and a pretty darn good one. Some of his work made it to the best known tattoo magazines in world. He took pride in his work and remained skillful in his craft. Logan was an engineer and could make a rocketship from the spare parts of a beat up Volkswagen Beetle. They never took the time to know each other’s personal history. All they knew was that one could paint and the other could make tools to paint with. They got along fine for the most part.

Yo Logan, asked Brady, I know we agreed to not ask each other stupid questions but it would make my remaining time here more or less bearable if I knew how a guy like you wound up in a place like this.”

The truth is Brady, replied Logan, I fell victim to a game I did not understand the rules to. I played at high stakes and lost.

”Dont give me that crap, protested Brady, who was the one who had your back when the Mexicans wanted your head for ruining the drug trade with the blacks. If it wasn’t for me you would be in a wheelchair or worse.”

“How about this, offered Logan, tatoo that drawing of Marilyn Monroe hanging from your bunk and ill tell you the whole story.”

“Good one Logan, replied Brady, me and Monroe are staying together through thick and thin. But I can tattoo my latest drawing. I stayed up all night sketching this. And you dont want to know how long it took me to think of the concept.”

“Deal, concurred Logan, so what do you want to know?

“How did you end up in a place like?” this responded Brady.

”Long story short I murdered the man my wife was cheating on me with, concluded Logan. At first everyone believed it was a love crime so i got a minimum sentence. Upon my release i murdered the first guy who looked at me the wrong way. That was my second strike. Finally, I did my parole officer and that was strike three. If the autopsy didn’t reveal that he had enough drugs in his system to support a small party i would have probably gotten the death sentence.”

“Wow Logan, replied Brady, way to lay it on gently. Also remind me not to get into any staring contest with you .

One waited for the other to laugh before the release of the lightness within his being but eventually both were engulfed in merry laughter.  They both drank and shared their commissary with one another. Brady took care not to drink too much because he valued his reputation as an artist too much to have anything he tattooed be considered subpar. Logan made sure to drink enough to make the pain as bearable as possible. He could build pretty much anything given the time and resources but he knew that the ink machine he created out of cd player parts was going to sting considerably compared to the tatoo guns from the shops.

“Are you sure you want this tattoo, asked Brady, it wont hurt me none if you decide you are better off without it.”

“Fire up the gun, replied Logan, and I will pretend you didn’t break one of the rules that has kept us off each other’s throats.“

“It’s hard to believe that a guy like you used to be a cold blooded killer admitted Brady, if i had to describe my experience with you from the time we spent locked up together I would say it was nothing less than spiritual. The sketch I drew was partly based on some of the teachings of the Tao but I would have never even heard of them if it were not for your sleep talking. I might have saved you from the brown and proud but you saved me too.”

“I think that shot of hooch got to your head Brady, answered Logan. If I am not mistaken I  have yet to ball up my fist or even pick up a weapon for that matter so how is that I saved you from anyone.“

“You saved me from myself, answered Brady.

“Keep that gun running Brady, said Logan, I think you might be drunk enough to let it turn off and sober enough to try to turn it back on. I am many things but a savior? Say how long did you let that stuff ferment for?”

“Not long enough, replied Brady.

They both shared a laugh worth its weight in gold. Logan enjoyed the rest of the night sipping the hooch they had prepared for moments like these. Brady only drunk enough to keep him focused on his craft. The rest of the night was comprised of Brady tattooing and Logan Enjoying the fermented drink. It was not long before morning came. Both were exhausted from staying up through the night but were ready for a new
