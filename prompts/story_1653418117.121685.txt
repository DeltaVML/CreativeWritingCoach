STORY:

We expected to find very little in the first few systems, what we didn’t expect was the desolated planets and husks of cities left behind. At first, we believed we had just found the unlucky few, planets that had over industrialised, or simply exhausted their resources. Soon it became clear that this wasn’t the case. 
  
It started on Gamma-2-9, believing it to be disrespectful to search the remains of civilisations we had passed by early planets once they were discovered to be barren of life. But eventually we had to investigate, too many planets were empty, or rather what we later found to be the truth: purged. 
  
On Gamma my team and I entered what seemed to be a research facility of sorts. We couldn’t make much of what we found until we hit the central control room. Somehow the power still worked, and when we turned things on, a single word appeared on every screen in the room: Run.
  
By the time we made it back to our ship, the first few had fallen to the madness. A voice spoke to them and bid them complete dreadful tasks, or so they claimed. After the first few deaths, we fled the system, believing it to be a technology we had yet to encounter. How wrong we were.
  
Each crew member that was corrupted, no… converted, had to be executed. There seemed to be no way of freeing them from the influential entities. Not every system had one of these so called ‘gods’, but the ones that did were added to an increasingly long list of off-limits systems.
  
The search goes on, but we don’t know when, or if, well ever find a safe place to call home.
