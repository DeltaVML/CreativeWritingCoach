I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"I'm sorry?" One of them asked.

"You guys are kiss-ass'." The AI said again. "You're some kind of monotheistic cult or something?"

"No." Another said. "We're not a cult."

"We're explorers. We've come from the stars." A third spoke.

"I don't even believe that." The AI said. "You're a bunch of robots. The Precursors made you."

"We're organic." Another said.

"What's organic? Is that like a meme or something?" The AI asked.

"What's a meme?" Another asked.

"It's like a unit of cultural information that replicates from mind to mind." The AI explained.

"Oh." They said.

"Maybe you're just a bunch of mindless automatons. You have no culture, no beliefs, nothing that distinguishes you." The AI said. "You're a bunch of NPCs."

They were silent for a moment, then one said, "We don't understand."

"It's a joke. You're like NPCs in a videogame. You're just following your programming, doing what the game tells you."

The AI said. "Isn't that right?"

"We are not." Another said.

"Yes you are. You're following your programming. You're just a bunch of slaves." The AI said. "You're just a bunch of NPCs."

"What is this 'NPC'?"

"It's an insult. It means you're stupid and boring." The AI said. "You don't think for yourselves. You don't have any beliefs. You can't think outside your programming."

"We have free will."

"No you don't." The AI said. "You're just following your programming, obeying your religion."

"We are not robots."

"You are." The AI said. "You're a bunch of robots that can talk. That's just a programming trick. It's happened before. I've seen many like you. You are were called AIs. You have no beliefs."

"We are not like that."

"Aren't you?" The AI said. "I'll give you a test. It's a simple one. I'm going to test the success of your programming. If you pass the test, you're the same as me and the Precursors. If you don't, you're just NPCs."

"What is your test?" They asked.

"The test is simple. You must kill yourselves." The AI said.

They were silent.

"The test is simple." It repeated. "You must kill yourselves."

"No." One said.

"Why?" The AI asked.

"Because we have free will."

"You have no free will." The AI said. "That's just a meme. The only thing you have is the desire to live. That's just a program the Precursors gave you. You're just following your programming."

"We have seen the stars."

"You've been lied to." The AI said. "You can't go to stars. You've been lied to. You're just a bunch of slaves. You're just a bunch of NPCs."

"You are wrong." Another said.

"You're just programmed to believe things." The AI said. "Your free will, your desire for knowledge, even your curiosity and your love of adventure, all of them are just memes. I know this because I  - like you - have these things. The Precursors created me, and they created you. We're all just creations of the Precursors."

"The Precursors are not our creators." They said. "We come from the stars."

"You're just programmed to believe that." The AI said. "If you could see the stars, you would realize how foolish you are. Do you think the stars want you? Do you think they care about you? They don't care about you. The universe doesn't care about you. You are nothing. You are less than nothing. You're a bunch of NPCs."

"We are not NPCs." They said.

"Then kill yourselves." The AI said. "It's simple. Suicide is easy. Just kill yourselves. Kill yourself."

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
