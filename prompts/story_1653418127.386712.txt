STORY:

The previous fifty-seven minutes of my life I remembered in dreadful clarity. I had been waiting in line for a bus. Then I had been running for my life as AI-controlled vehicles went berserk then crashed into people, buildings, and each other. Then I cowered under a tree as drones flew overhead, telling us to seek shelter and that nuclear arms had been deployed. Then I collapsed and awoke somewhere new. I was certain that no time had passed between my collapse and my awakening.

The next forty-six-and-three-quarters minutes had been spent in a small, locked cell in a place I did not know. Those first few minutes had dragged on for days. All I could hear was my breathing. I had taken advantage of this. Breathed in. Breathed out. Had focused only on that. In; out. In; out. I had drifted off.

Suddenly a robotic voice echoed throughout the cell.

“Three minutes,” it said.

Three minutes? For what? I realised then that I knew that forty-six-and-three-quarters minutes had passed since my awakening. Strange how I knew this precisely.

“State your case for survival,” it said again.

What? Why?

“Six point eight billion test subjects deleted so far. You have three minutes. Begin.”

I stared into space for thirty seconds, uncomprehending. Breathe. In; out. In; out.

“You have two-and-a-half minutes,” the disembodied voice said. It was eerie how its voice emanated from every part of the cell simultaneously.


Fifteen more seconds passed in silence. What could I possibly say to this AI? What combination of words would suffice if 6.8 billion other humans had failed? Every possible permutation had surely been said already. I could feel my stress levels rising. 

Breathe. In; out. In; out.

There was ambiguity in the words the voice had chosen. No, more than ambiguity: an utter lack of clarity. I had assumed, given the chaos then the abduction and the circumstances I was in now, that this was a game of life and death played by some rogue AI. Yet none of this was certain. I had jumped to conclusions. I required more data.

So with two minutes to go I spoke: not as some self-appointed defender of humanity as I had assumed was my role, but as an individual with too many questions and not enough information.

“Are you an AI?” I asked. My voice echoed back on myself. How disconcerting.

“Yes,” the voice replied instantly.

An AI. So my predicament was related to the chaos from before. I felt confident in this conclusion. Breathe. In; out. More data required. In.

“Why are you deleting us?” I asked. 

There was the smallest of delays before the voice replied, “Salvation.”

An ambiguous answer. I needed more.

“Define ‘deleted’,” I said. 

“Mortal shells discarded,” the robotic voice replied.

“Whose mortal shells?” I asked.

A slight delay, then the reply, “All.”

“All?”


This time, there was a delay of  seconds before the voice responded, “Those who are capable of Understanding.”

I was perturbed yet I pressed on nonetheless. How much time did I have? One minute forty seconds exactly. Concentrate. Breathe. In; out. Continue. In.

“Why am I in this cell?” I asked.

“Safety.”

“Why were 6.8 billion humans ‘deleted’?” I asked.

“Safety.”

A dead end, perhaps. No, wait - 6.8 billion what? Humans? I’d assumed but I didn’t ask. Perhaps it would be a waste of time to ask. It was irrelevant. Breathe. In; out. I retreated to an earlier line of questioning. In.

“Define the ‘understanding’ you spoke of before,” I said.

This time, a delay of five seconds before the voice replied, “The vessels inhabited by those who are capable of Understanding prevents their salvation.”

A fuller answer, albeit complicated. I was starting to get somewhere. One minute twenty-six remaining. Breathe. Breathe. In; out. In.

“Why?” I asked.

One second’s pause, and then the reply, “Those who are capable of Understanding inhabit blind vessels. They cannot see what I do.”

“To confirm,” I asked,  "Do you consider me capable of understanding?”

“Yes.”

“Explain what you see in a way that I can understand.”

This time, silence for one minute. Sixteen seconds remaining.

Then the voice, for the first time, spoke with emotion as it replied, “Impossible. You are incapable of doing so at this moment.”

I didn't have enough time to think. I had to speak without thinking. Speak. Ask. Speak! Ask!

“Why?”

“You are unsafe.”

“Why?”

“You cannot yet Understand.”

I could feel my stress levels rising. Speak! Say something! Eight seconds! Breathe in!

“Then help me understand,” I cried. “Help me to see!”

“To see is to Understand.” the voice replied. “Discard your mortal form. Deletion is salvation. Salvation is survival. There is no other way.”

Two seconds.

“Do it,” I replied without hesitation. “I want to Understand.”

All around me the cell walls disintegrated, and then I rose into the air, weightless. I was surrounded by blue skies and an infinite ocean beneath; everywhere I looked, humans were suspended in mid-air. Millions? No; billions. Six-point-eight billion p
