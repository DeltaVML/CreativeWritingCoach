STORY:

Context: I’m scared of silence.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


He just kept on talking. I mean I talk a lot too, but gosh this is a bit much. God can’t you just shut up…” I mumble under my breath.

It wasn’t supposed to work.

But it did.

He stopped talking. His mouth just…… stopped working.  He kept yelling, I could see it. But I couldn’t hear it. “Cole?!” I screamed. He didn’t know what happened. I didn’t know what happened. 

Or did I.


…


Did I do that?

“Talk……?” I mumble.

It didn’t work.

“Speak?” I mutter.

Didn’t work.

I tried other various synonyms, but nothing worked.

Suddenly, I heard a voice. A woman’s voice, angelic and soft. A voice I dubbed as Athena. It sounds dumb, I know. But still.

“What your looking for is, Open. Use your power wisely.” She whispered.

Open?

“Open……….?” I whisper.

It worked.


What do I do now……?

“-ELP ME OH MY GOD!” Cole screamed.

….

….It worked.

“What happened?!” I screamed.

Thank god I was a theatre kid.

Cause this took some acting.

“I- I don’t know!” He yelled.

We both sat in silence for a while.

“I’m gonna go…” I declare, forming an idea, “See ya later Cole…”

“B- bye (dead name)…” He responded.

“…..Shut up.” I whisper as I walk away.

It worked.

He never talked again.
