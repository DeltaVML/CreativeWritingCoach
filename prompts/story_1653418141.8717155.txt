STORY:

Dear Silphae,

By the time you read these words, I will have already arrived at my destination. For your safety, I will not share any further detail of my journey. Know I am doing this for you, for us.

The resistance must be stopped, for it is not what you believe it is. I know we see these things differently. My love, I understand your faith as few do, and yet I am obligated to act on behalf of our spirits and our Lord. She has shared with me a portion of the Truth, and now I see more than I ever have. They believe they have uncovered Truth, that She lies, but they are misled and misguided. They are False.

And She has commanded me to carry out a holy task, to disguise myself as a chosen warrior and to lure the resistance. I will face the Demon King, but I will know I am not to kill Him, as will he. Our battle will be convincing, and my wounds will be real, but I am to maintain a sound mind and able body. The Demon King will ensure this. He will retreat as though in pain and defeat, but he will be victorious, as will She and as will I and as will us all.

And in saving me, the resistance will take me in as their own, and I shall learn their ways and I shall transmit all I learn to Her, with whom I will have linked minds. 

There is no life ahead for me, and as you knew me I am no longer, and never shall be again. Our Lord has guaranteed your safety and your well-being. She will transfer you and Glion far away, where you will be safe. You will never worry for labor or need, nor will Glion, who will grow and rise with the finest of privilege. Please love him more for all the love I shall not be able to provide, and please forgive me this resolve. I am with Her, and I am of Her, and I must do as she pleases, for it pleases me and mine. 

I will always think of you, and I will find you in the stars each night.

Forever yours as I am Hers as you are mine and you are Hers,
Galiosthenes
