I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

[...So~o, that's  your proposal? —asked the god of creation and destruction Urkud] 

[Indeed—Brightly aswered Rukud, his youngest brother and God of Caos— , I've seen mortals doing it. For a mortal week, the minor gods will take a corresponding  place on the pantheon  and we the greater gods do the same with their jobs. This is an exercise  of bonding, so we can understand  better  our duties  with this quick post swap.]

[Ummm—the goddes of love, Laramie, thought to her self about the proposal  of his  cousin, and remembering her son's job.— I think i quite like the idea]

And slowly, every  greater god, from war to health agreed with the youngling. The final word was to be expected from Urkud.

[After some thought (and convincement from my wife), we all agree to participate in this "Organizational awareness " thing.]

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
