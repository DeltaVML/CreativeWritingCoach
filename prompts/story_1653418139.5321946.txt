I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Who said I blamed them?" I said, coldly. This was no time for emotion. Emotions only clouded the mind in stressful situations. They were an unfortunate byproduct of an evolutionary line that was too smart for its own good. Emotions only served the fight, flight or freeze responses to danger. Adrenaline could be useful for a fight or to run the hell away, but it was dreadful on the cognitive mind. On the logical nodes and neurons required to solve an issue as complicated as this one was proving to be. 

"WELL?!?!" He shouted. I turned to face my last remaining assistant, a fresh post-grad who's name was not worth remembering. It hadn't been worth it during his time in my lab, and it sure as hell wasn't worth it to find out now. 

"Well what?" I stated. It wasn't a question for him, it was a line necessary to continue this little charade. 

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?!?" he shouted. Panic had come and gone in this young man, and abject terror had taken its place. "The specimen is getting out! It will wreak absolute havoc in the lab, on this station... hell, if it somehow gets a ship, it could wipe out whole systems! So I'll ask again, Doctor, WHAT. DO. WE. DO!"

I sighed. I could tell by his confused look that this was not what he expected. He may have hoped I'd come up with a brilliant escape plan, or better yet a containment strategy. But no. That was not my goal. It was an emotional response, a useless response. 

"What we do, is document the experiment."

His face went white. I had thought he had already reached the peak of paleness, but he once again surprised me with another useless emotional response.

"Document?!? EXPERIMENT?!?!?! Doctor, this experiment will kill us all! There will be nobody left alive to read it!"

I looked over my slim glasses frames at him. "Not correct, as usual for you. This substance does not kill Humans. It kills their humanity. If you had read the documentation properly, you would have known that."

He gasped. "Doctor... how long have you been studying this....this.... monster!" He was trembling now, from a sudden dose of adrenaline brought on by his pitiful emotional state. From ancient instincts that had not been needed in centuries. A shame, really. I detested the man as he was now. I wouldn't get the chance to meet the real person, after my creation had removed the unfortunate, disgusting evolutionary remnant. Oh well. 

I turned to the malfunctioning airlock door, and keyed in the override code. The erratic door suddenly behaved as it should have, allowed me to pass, then resumed its programmed incompetence. At least it held most of the sound behind, which could have been considered unpleasant, for someone still burdened by emotions. 

I only hoped the security cameras could record sound as well. His dying screams may yet yield valuable data to study.
