STORY:
================================

I walked through the marketplace, surprised by the display of noblemen and women providing food and items to the poor for free, freely distributing riches to them all, including myself when I held out my hands. No questions asked. I decided to make conversation with one of the nobles preparing to leave, having given away all of the wealth he intended to give this morning. I wanted to know more about them, and they surely wanted to know more about me considering how interesting of a man I was.

“My name’s Kareem,” I said, standing proudly in front of him. 

He looked me up and down, smiling awkwardly. He had been preparing to take his mule home.

“Hi Kareem. I haven’t any more food, unfortunately. But I’m sure if you hurry, there will still be plenty going around.”

“It means ‘noble,’” I said, smiling broadly. 

“I’m sorry?” he looked over his shoulder and another nobleman who shrugged his shoulders and listened in to the conversation. They both wore robes that were dignified and expensive, yet somehow modest.

“The name ‘Kareem.’ It means noble,” I replied. 

“Oh,” the nobleman forced a smile. “Well, that’s very nice, Kareem. Nice name.”

“It can also mean generous,” I informed him.  

“Right,” he nodded, looking over his shoulder once more, staring pointedly at the other nobleman who shrugged even more broadly. 

“So, clearly, I’m a very noble man. By the name. I hear you have to be noble in these parts otherwise you lose a lot of status. So what makes you noble?” I asked. 

“Oh, ummm,” the man in front of me scratched the back of his head, and the other spoke up on his behalf,

“Percival gives freely of his wealth. So much so that his left hand cannot keep track of how much his right hand distributes,” he said. 

“Do not inflate my ego, Randal,” Percival said sternly. He turned back to me with a patient smile. “The term ‘noble’ is an objective one.”

“Then surely I am a noble,” I beamed. 

Randal and Percival looked between one another with strained, awkward looks. Probably embarrassed by how confident I was in my nobility. 

“How is it measured?” I asked.

“Measured? Something either is or is not. How does one measure truth?” Percival said sagely. 

“Interesting. So, how do I determine that I am more noble than you?” I asked. 


“More noble?” Percival’s voice was strained.

“An odd question,” Randal agreed. “One would not claim they are more modest than another.”

“Why not? I’m modest. More modest than anyone I know, that’s for certain!” I proudly claimed. 

Randal averted his gaze, suppressing a smile, but Percival’s forehead formed a vein. 

“Anyway, I should be leaving,” Percival breathed out. 

“Why? Are you afraid to answer my questions? That means you’re stupid, huh?” I asked. 

Percival grunted under his breath. Randal giggled under a hand covering his mouth, amused by something I didn’t understand. I was probably too smart to get it. 

“I just... need to be going now,” Percival said slowly, breathing deeply. 

“You’re a coward, huh. Whoever heard of a noble coward, right Randal?” I scoffed. 

“Please stop,” Percival said. 

“Come on now. You’re supposed to be a noble, but you run at the first reveal of your lack of intelligence? You should be gracious to learn new things!” I said, poking his chest playfully. Percival looked infuriated. Randal had gone into fits of laughter. 

“Stop. Talking,” Percival said sternly. 

“I get it. You’re just pretending to be a noble. I’m the only one Kareem enough to be a noble. Get it, cause my name? You should be embarrassed to be in my presence. It’s sad that you can’t even be in my area without being scared and ashamed,” I chuckled.

“Enough!” Percival shouted. “You offensive, insolent, ill-bred ingrate! You are not a noble! You are less than a peasant! Your characters disgusts those around you and you will never have companions so long as you continue acting the fool!” 

I stared at him for a few moments. Randal had quickly turned from laughter to staring in horror. I sniffed loudly. 

“I am so very sorry,” Percival said quickly. 

“I’m…” I wiped a tear building up in one of my eyes. “I’m fine. I’m fine.”

“I did not mean it, I’m sorry!” Percival repeated, panicked. A thread came undone in his robe. “No, no!” he exclaimed. 

“What—” I sniffed again. “What’s happening?”

“I said I’m sorry, did you not forgive me?” Percival asked quickly, grabbing tightly to his clothing. 

“You were really mean!” I exclaimed, my voice cracking pathetically. “What’s going on?”

“His nobility is draining,” Randal informed solemnly.

“It was one mistake! Nobles cannot all be perfect!” Percival pleaded to Randal. 

“I cannot help you. Like you said, nobility is objective,” Randal replied. 

“No!” Percival’s robes had disintegrated into rags. His mule brayed and kicked him before running off. I watched with a hint of excitement, happy to see such a mean guy get quick just desserts. Percival sobbed and punched the ground aggressively as Randal prepared his own mule to leave.
