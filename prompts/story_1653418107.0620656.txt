I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“You could stab that guy in the alley and no one would notice.” Said the unwelcome voice in his head. “Take his purse. Buy some food. You deserve it..”

“And his wife would probably notice he’s missing, start an investigation- I just don’t have that kind of time.” The hero’s stomach growled, but he wouldn’t give into any voice in his head. Not even his own. 

“All the power in the world is available to you, slapping against your legs-“

“Thanks, pal.” He said playfully.

The voice growled and grew hot in his head- of annoyance and embarrassment. 

“I am talking about *me*. Through *me* you could have all the power in the world, yet you leave me tied against your waist.” It snarled, trying to shave away the moral walls in the hero’s mind.

“I didn’t think swords could have penises.” He said aloud as he passed a trio maidens shopping, who looked at him befuddled. The hero smiled politely and waved.

Now the voice was creating a storm within his brain, bringing on a searing headache. The hero merely winced but kept walking through the marketplace, focusing on his hunger and for a bite to eat.

“DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE INSULTING?!” The sword thundered.

“I really don’t, and I wouldn’t care to know. Now hush before I bury you in a forgotten well full of dirt.” He said with a strained expression.

The storm fell away and the sword conceded, giving the hero a moment to look at his surroundings. This village in particular was quiet. In the hustle and bustle under the setting sun, this was probably his best chance to sneak something to eat.

He didn’t consider himself a thief. Food was created from the planet, so why should he pay for it? Because someone else claimed it?

Mostly because he was broke. Always broke. But only because money was a human concept and one he didn’t agree with.

“Why have you kept me, then?” The sword asked.

“Gotta have a sword. They’re hella expensive and the guy who had you last wasn’t using it anymore.”

“He was dead.” 

“Yeah, that’s what I said.” He retorted. The sword did not like his new owner, but wasn’t willing to give up on a challenge.

“So what is ultimate power to you?” The sword asked him.

“Freedom to do what I want, without much effort.” He replied.

“Like…a king? I can make you a king.” 

“*That* is way too much effort. Plus, I’m not a killer. Bad luck for you.” He said and the sword fell away again.

The hero’s luck, however, had changed. A weary and bloodied salesman was riding by in a horse drawn carriage. His cargo had been struck with arrows, no doubt from wood bandits. And falling out the end of his carriage was an abundance of fruit. Children were grabbing them as they fell, laughing happily. 

He quickly and slyly kicked a few apples into the air and caught them in his gi shirt pocket. He winked at the kid who saw him and whistled away to an alley, unnoticed by any adults.

“You’re a bottom feeder.” The sword insulted.

“I like the term *opportunist.*” he corrected as he took a bite.

He thought about the friends he left back home as he ate his dinner. Nobody was really free anymore, and it did bother him that he abandoned so many. But would they do anything for him? 

Then he thought about what the sword meant about *ultimate power.* 

“…so what is the ultimate power?” He asked.

“Let me taste blood and you’ll find out.” 

“…What if it’s my own blood?” He asked.
