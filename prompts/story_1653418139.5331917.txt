I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.

"Oh, screw you! Don't blame the science department for this mess. The science went PERFECTLY. It's not OUR fault that site command decided to skimp out on the sites security and containment systems" Senior Researcher Dave finished, as 05-4 walked through the door. "Oh, I didn't see you there sir. How much of that did you hear?" Dave said, after noticing 05-4. "Enough for context." 05-4 said, their face concealed in a mask of darkness that never seemed to disappear, even under direct light. Their voice distorted, and still understandable but you would never be able to tell who it was.

&amp;#x200B;

"Dave, I'll say it again. Site command, even though Dr. Bright is currently on site, would overspend before they EVER underspent on security." Security Officer Jane said. "ATTENTION ALL ON-SITE PERSONNEL, DR. BRIGHT HAS LIT THE CONTAINMENT CONTROLS FOR SCP-173 ON FIRE... AGAIN. SECURITY PERSONNEL REPORT TO ARMORY, ALL OTHER PERSONNEL REPORT TO THE NEAREST BREACH SHELTER."

&amp;#x200B;

And so ends the adventures of Dave, Jane, and 05-4.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, we're always watching.

05-4

**wait, is that screaming I hear?**
