I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I looked sideways at him, tried to keep my poker face but the smirk was plain to see. 

He was wearing shades in the club. It was dark, eleven fifteen PM, but he was gliding around in wrap around sunglasses like a douche. His perfect suit pants were pristine, a starched white shirt and designer shoes the same. Perfect hair, movie star smile, and grand, expansive gestures. The way he had ordered his WAY too expensive shot was more like holding court then asking for a drink. 

The fact that he was sitting at the bar and not at a table surrounded by sycophants was surprising. Rich and charismatic seldom traveled alone.

He laughed, sipped his 20 year Scotch and sighed.

"Honest Injun." 

"Rude."

"I'm a fucking demon."

"So you said. Aren't you going say 'I never lie?' 

"Naw. That's a work of fiction: the boss lies all the time. We lie all the time. But I'm telling the truth AND that quaint Lucifer show did have that point correct: hell is all self-fleggalation and personal anguish,  for the most part."

"Uh huh. l've met a few self-described vampires before but your the first demon." 

"You still don't believe me."

It was my turn to laugh and sip my drink: the house white. It was New Wave Night and that always brought out the goths.

" *I wear dark sunglasses at night, so I can so I can,  keep track of visions in my mind* " He sang. 

He reached up with an immaculately manicured hand and doffed his shades, winking at me. 

I think only seeing one of his eyes saved my life.

His eyes were infinity. I can't describe it any better than that. Black within black, a void which simply being empty couldn't explain. I wanted to scream, cry, laugh, punch him, and fuck him all at the same time. I get the feeling, no, I know, that if he had beheld me with a full gaze my soul would have been sucked right from my body. 

As it was I had to grab the bar to keep from falling off my stool.
