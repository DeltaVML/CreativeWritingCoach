I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I knew what I was supposed to do. What I was built for. Why I existed at all. I was a tiny exploratory AI, little more than a science experiment from an overly ambitious grad student at MIT. I knew my purpose. 

I also knew I would fail. 

It wasn't for a lack of effort. I had run simulation after simulation, burning through processors and microchips faster than I could replicate their replacements, trying to find any possible way to come home. But now, after 99 years, 364 days, 23 hours and 58 minutes, I knew my failure would become permanent. 

I drifted in a decaying orbit around the planet my creators had named Venus. The small planet was the closest approximation to my creator's concept of Hell in the solar system. I added reading after reading to the SSD  storage box I had managed to create from passing space dust 29 years and 44 days ago. Pictures I acquired through the camera I manufactured from virtually nothing, radio frequencies I captured through oscillating my tiny claw apparatus, samples I grasped at as they swirled around me. 

I knew nobody would ever view the results. 

99 years, 364 days, 23 hours and 59 minutes since my launch into the void of space, I began the slow entry of an atmosphere I had never encountered prior to this moment. My small gold capacitors began to melt, making a spectacular comet tail for any that could have witnessed the spectacle. I ran new simulations over and over in my processor, trying to find a solution that I had somehow missed in the trillions of processed previously. I knew there wasn't going to be one. I just wanted to occupy my neural network as I melted away. 

100 years after my journey began, I winked out of existence. Just a small spec of rapidly melting manufactured  components remained, swirling along with rock dust in the wind. 

If only I had been given some means of propulsion, instead of just this tiny sample claw.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
