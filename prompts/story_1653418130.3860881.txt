I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Why?" I echoed, idly touching the scabs and scars covering my bare lower legs. I looked up at her royal majesty through the bars of my cell, at her beautiful dress and her expensive juwelry. Her very presence, sitting on a cheap chair in this dark and unadorned prison, felt vaguely wrong. A steeper contrast than between my prison rags and her expensive clothing was barely possible. But yet, here she was.

"Do you remember the last winter?" I asked.

She started nodding, but I wasn't finished.

"Do you remember the big parties and feasts you and your peers had in the autumn, for which you raised special taxes on my village? Do you remember how early and harsh the snow came, when we were not yet prepared enough to all survive with what we had? Do you remember when my brother, Adom Miller, went into the Royal Forest to hunt, driven by hunger, and your sheriff hanged him for the crime of wanting to eat?"

Somewhere in the middle of my rant, she had stopped nodding and started staring, and then stopped staring and started shaking her head. She locked eyes with me, only for a moment.

"No." she answered, finally. "I didn't know about your loss. I'm..."

I cut her off. Maybe she had wanted to sympathise. Maybe she had wanted to apologize. Maybe she had wanted to mock me. I didn't care.

"And that-" I told her, grinning with a mix of anger and sadness "-that is exactly the reason why."

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
