I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I had seen them all.

The simpler ones like bombers or shooters whose weapons I could absorb with smooth jazz. The scientists who I could convince to lay off their plans by outsmarting them through Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and the like. The crazy teenagers who I talked off of buildings with Linkin Park playing not only in my head, but in theirs too in many cases. The guy who poisoned the water of a town, allowing me to listen to the band poison for a day - that was one of the nicer ones.

And the more unusual ones.

The gal who wanted to turn the world into some kind of spaghetti monster, forcing me to listen to we no speak Americano on repeat. Ugh.

The twins who I fought with nothing but duets in my ears - you know, fight fire with fire.

The businessman who wanted to buy the whole world, stopped by a series of seminars, podcasts and TED talks on finances that almost bored me to death.

I had seen them all, and many more. Nothing could surprise me, I thought.

Well, I was wrong.

Because while the world's best dancer explains to me their evil plan to make *everybody* do the twist, I realise there is only one way to stop this madness. I press play, and let the mental image of elevator doors opening flood through me to prepare for the ultimate dance-off.

OPPA GANGNAM STYLE!

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
