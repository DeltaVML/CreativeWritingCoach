STORY:

The fact that the ship was a little under seventy kilometers across, bobbed like a cork in water in our troposphere, or that telescopes had found that the 'wire' ended Ï€ light-seconds celestially north of our orbital plane, didn't change the disturbing feeling that this was all an elaborate gag.

World governments had broken out in a frenzy of thinly veiled jockeying for position as 'Representatives of Earth'. Threats were made, plans were submitted, ambassadors were assassinated, and eventually the big three--U.S.A., Russia, and China--had flown out delegations. Which the visitors utterly ignored. Their helicopters, unable to attract the aliens' attention, tried landing on the flying saucer. The flying saucer was briefly, but intensely, electrified. The ionization glow was visible as a beautiful aurora, seen and enjoyed by half a billion people as it lit the night sky over Africa. And the delegations of interstellar governments were gone, reduced to ash and radiation.

The extra-terrestrials had then launched a landing craft, apparently made out of popsicle sticks and hot glue, which landed in an empty field in the Siberian tundra. There they waited.

I finished donning the contact protocol suit, and one of the techs taped up the final gaps. I was in the second contact group. We had mostly the same equipment, with the addition of adult diapers worn under the containment suits. Squeaking in my plastic outfit, I stepped out of the cargo helicopter, and looked around at the team I would be assisting. 

Big, smiling men, in rich suits and expensive shoes, practicing the (second) most politically savvy handshakes in the world on each other. Translators and linguistic experts for every language they could (still) find volunteers for, in hopes that one of them had some foundational similarities that could be used to facilitate communication. Artistic curators, carrying (hastily reproduced) displays of art and culture, dressed in garish collections of textures and colors, in case the aliens wanted to see what we had accomplished. A naked couple, the (second) most physically perfect specimens the government could find, paid obscene amounts of money to model the human animal for our guests. And us, the (second) first-contact containment team. In case the aliens coughed.

In the distance, we saw them. Nine meters tall, thin and wooly. Their eyes wobbled in their plastic sockets. Their pipe-cleaner arms waved invitingly. Their feet... They didn't have feet. Beneath their tubular exterior, my brain tried to interprete as the aliens floating just off the ground. *Something* filled those galactic socks, but I couldn't actually perceive it. I only saw that it left long, writhing furrows in the frozen dirt, leading back to the landing craft.

One by one, the delegations of the nuclear nations approached, signalling peace, offering outstretched hands. One by one, the linguists chattered greetings, working through hundreds of languages. One by one, the curators smiled shakily as they showed images of paintings, temples, and movie posters. One by one, the pretty couple turned slowly in circles, exposing themselves methodically, reveling in the attention.

One of the things turned, and I briefly thought it might be looking at me, so I waved, awkwardly. It waved back.

And then it spoke. We never did figure out what it said.

The pretty people were ushered onboard the popsicle stick craft. Then the artists, the linguists. Then, finally, the politicians. The aliens smiled their puppet smiles, their googly eyes wobbled invitingly. The one that waved at me slowly reached up and lifted one giant, false eye with its pipe-cleaner hand... and something in the wet blackness beneath rolled and boiled, slithering significantly in a meaning I could not possibly recognize, yet somehow immediately understood. 

Then, satisfied with their new toys, the aliens closed the door to the craft. It bobbed artificially off the ground for a moment, and then from inside, the screaming began. I stood, helpless, watching the (second) best and brightest of humanity be abducted, their maddening howls audible even under the containment hoods we wore, as they were transported back to the giant pie-plate decoy ship.

The rest of the containment team looked at me. I looked back at them--grey faces, dark eyes, frightened looks--and had no answers. Then I looked back at the furrows the creatures had left in the Siberian permafrost, and the diapers we had been issued were immediately useful.

Empty, vacant tracks, but *they were still moving.*
