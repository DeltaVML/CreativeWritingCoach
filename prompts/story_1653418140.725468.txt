I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Trigger warning: swearing

“Done.” Said Jeffery, wiping the sweat off of his forehead. 

I was legitimately scared at what was standing in front of me. It was a three story tall sphere with a lever attached.

“What the fuck is this right now!?” I shouted.

“An AI pod. So, I did a couple things, now it’s evolved beyond any comprehensible understanding. So yeah, this thing is supposed to destroy it.” Jeff replied calmly.

“What!?”

“But now it hacked the pod so I was trying to get rid of it manually, but that didn’t work out. So now it hacked into one of my old creations.”

“WHAT!?!?” 

“Yeah, the burn-o-matic. That one virus that blows up your computer, remember? Stored in a small one-terabyte drive? Well, the AI reprogrammed it and hacked into all of my old creations.”

“How the fuck did I miss this?” 

“You were shackled to my bed.”

“Let’s not speak about that.”

“So yeah, the world is now in ruins and the Android apocalypse is rampaging.”

“And what does that pod have to do with anything?”

“Oh, this is a sphere for storing black holes now. I love recycling.” Jeff said as the roof opened up, revealing a skyscraper-sized crab, hollering at its progenitor. A funky song started playing in the background as a robotic blue glow traced a long wall up the crab’s leg and into its eye.

“WHAT IS HAPPENING, JEFF!?” 

“I dunno. I swear the coffee machine worked yesterday. Oh, right.” He said and pulled a part of the giant black-hole holding sphere away before plucking it back into the coffee machine, as the entire world started pulling into the now collapsing sphere.

The last moments of my life were spiced up by time dilation, as, for a few seconds, I saw the scenery change from a dilapidated warehouse, to a desert, to space, before a spaceship came closer and…

The fourth dimension twisted me to madness as I drooled on the remnants of my sanity, with nothing to exist for me. I died of old age, having witnessed how the fourth dimension discombobulates us, humans.
