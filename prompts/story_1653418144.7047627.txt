I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

_A feeling of deja-vu is perfectly natural_

You think, not paying particular attention to the sign on the cold metal wall, ignoring the pull of gravity on your poor stomach. Thoughts of your new job, the giddy feel of success outweighing all the anxiety you had felt when applying for the countless jobs you’d tried for over the past week.

In fact, it took another glance to properly read the sign, realising you had skimmed over it and in fact, had completely misread it the first time around.

_How odd_.

You weren’t exactly sure what to do. On one hand, the sign said to report to management, on the other, if management told you to jump off a cliff you wouldn’t exactly do it.

Deja-vu wasn’t pertinent to job satisfaction, wasn’t relating to your job nor your field, and didn’t seem concerning over all. Why mention it and risk blowing something that had finally gone well for you?

_But_… icy fear filled your veins, the telltale grips of anxiety throttling you once again as your happiness disappeared as quickly as a drop of water down the sink. You couldn’t afford to blow this. 

You had so many things to pay for- student debt, your ailing father, food, water, and most importantly besides all that- rent. Money was running low and with no other jobs or interviews in sight, you were extremely hesitant to blow this.

_It’s probably a survey or something…_

The thought ran through your mind, as your arms wrapped around your waist, the elevator hesitating, freezing almost, before continuing up for one more short burst.

_Do I stay or do I go?_

The thought idly flitted through your mind like the song, as the doors shuddered, preparing to peel open.   Inexplicably, _The Matrix_ came into your head, and in your thoughts, two hands appeared, a blue pill, a red pill.

_Stay. Go_

With a hum, you decided to just run the risk, your nerves not taking another anxiety riddled interaction with someone, heading to your new desk as gleefully directed by Derek, who was a bit work obsessed on first impression, but nice enough.

He’d certainly make up for your shyness, anyway.

Not that you’d ever know, but it was a good thing you hadn’t decided to go to management. You didn’t want to know what horrors the last person who experienced deja-vu went through, before being spat out into the machine once again.

Let’s just say, you might’ve worked this job before.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
