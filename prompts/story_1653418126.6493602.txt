STORY:

“It’s your turn.” The intern shook his head. 

“I already told you I’m not doing that.”

“Look, I hate to pull rank or anything but it will negatively affect your performance review and future here if you keep refusing to be a team player” 

The intern - gosh, what was his name again, I really should focus more during the introductions. Josh? I deepened my voice and leaned forward across the desk. 

“Look, Josh…”

“I’m John. Look, is there anyone else I can talk to?” He fiddled nervously with his pen. How old could he be? 22? 23? Just out of college. Ambitious. Focused. I remembered those days. And I remember no one cutting me any slack whatsoever.

“… John. I’ve been in your shoes, you might not believe it but it feels like yesterday…”

“Literally, anyone. I’m not gonna take order from a kid. This is ridiculous. And I’m not doing THAT.”

Shit. I thought back to just the other day. Solidly middle management. Master of the office pranks. Fucker of not one but two executive secretaries. I looked over Josh’s, no, John’s, shoulder and my reflection in the window made me wince once again. I desperately tried to tighten my tie but it felt like a noose. I scrubbed my finger against the wispy beginning of a moustache that itched my upper lip. 

“Come oooooooon, man.” Shit. My voice broke. A bad one this time. My acne-ridden cheeks burned from embarrassment and I could feel the tears welling up.

“Fuck. Shit. Sorry, kid, I didn’t mean to… I mean, Sir. Just find someone else. I don’t even know how to change a diaper.” Well 

“We can’t let him sit in his own shit any longer, he’s gonna start crying and it’s all smelly and I don’t want to get fired, Josh, come on man, just this once. Why can’t you just be cool!?”

John put down his pen on the edge of my desk and took off his key card.

“I quit. I am so over this. You know I don’t even get paid, right?”

He was gone before I knew it and I couldn’t help feeling respect for his integrity. Not many interns would have the balls to stand up to me. Well, until I turned 12 again. 

I took a deep breath and walked into the corridor. I gagged, knowing what waited beyond the door in front of me. Until yesterday I had never changed a diaper. The shit. The humiliation. What I wouldn’t do for a promotion.

“I’m so sorry to interrupt you, I know as CEO you are a very busy man, but people are starting to complain about the smell.”

My boss pulled his finger out of his nose and squeeled with joy as he crawled towards me.
