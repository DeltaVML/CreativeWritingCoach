I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

It should have been spring by now. The sun would have hung in the sky, ever so slightly warming the basking rabbits who finally could come out in the open. We would have been out, my brother and I, racing through the open fields with new grass growing under our barefoot skin.

Sighing, I turned away from the window and sat back down on the chair. On the other side of the table sat Henry, his face frozen in anticipation, eagerly waiting. For him, I was the one who would solve all his problems, but the poor soul hadn't a clue that I had no clue on how to proceed. There aren't exactly courses you go through when you become a genie. Just a disembodied voice telling you things, like a commentary inside your head.

The fingers made a soft *plop* sound as I cracked them for what seemed the thousandth time. There was no way I could give this guy what he wanted, not because I could not, but because I didn't know how to.

Out of habit, my eyes flicked to the clock on the wall, its second hand stuck at the number 30. 

"How do I do it?" I asked, hoping that this time He would answer.

No one answered back. I was truly alone.

I got back up and started to pace the room, pausing at times to see all the photos on the office wall. Henry looked happy in all of them, ones with his kid, with his wife and the whole team, a far cry from the whizened man who now sat across me.

His had been a simple ask, one I thought could just do with a snap of my fingers. But then He had spoken, his voice echoing all around me. No magic, what did He mean no magic?

Out of the corner of my eye I say a faded photo. A photo of Henry with his father in the corn fields, his mouth twisted in laughter, his Dad with his hand on Henry's back. A special moment shared between the two was no captured for all eternity. 

Is this what eternity feels like?

"I will rip it out." I said, as I reached Henry. I pushed my hands through his chest, and they slid right in.

I fiddled around a little, and finally felt a big mass, a mass that shouldn't have been there. I gave it a little tug and out it came in my hands. I took my hands out of Henry's chest and started at the little blackened piece that had made Henry's life a living hell. Without a thought I went to the open window behind him and threw it out.

Moving back to my seat, I took a deep breath and sat down again. As soon as I sat, there seemed like undercurrent ran through the enclosed space, as Henry's eyes started to sparkle again.

"Can you cure me?" He repeated.

I smiled and sat back confidently. I snapped my fingers and exclaimed, "It is done."
