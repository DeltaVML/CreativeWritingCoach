I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“My opinion? I see the effort as vacuous. Egotistical. An unnecessary waste of time and money that could be better spent on any number of other projects that would better serve us now and in the future.”

“You don’t think we should leave something for those that come after us?”

Dr Carlisle turned her blue-lit face from her laptop to Dr Hamish, who appeared to her in the low light of her dark office as a squat silhouette in the doorway — a creature from the land of the bright hallway that had deigned to enter her solitary, shadowed domain. Though her usual stoic expression was present there was a measure of pity in her hazel gaze. To her, it was all so obvious. 

“Why would it matter to *them*? You’re assuming they — whatever it is *they* are — care, or are even capable of caring. Moreover, to get the information they would be capable of: reaching the moon, interacting with our technology, and deciphering our likely long extinct languages. They would learn nothing other than that we were here.”

“And about our culture.”

“Culture? If we want to provide evidence of our culture, then we can accomplish the same thing by firing a time-capsule up there. One that contains a sword, a donut, a flute, and a book.”

“Wh-”

“Most cultures on Earth eventually make some form of each. Besides, what use would a space-fairing, interstellar race have for the collected young-adult, vampire-themed, teen-romance novels of a long dead species? The effort is one not based in accomplishing anything other than a post extinction-event form of self-preservation, intended to make sure the universe remembers us. All of this born from the belief that we are special and matter. We are not *special*, Hamish. We are just matter.”

At this, Dr Carlisle ended the conversation the same way she so often did: she turned her focus back to her laptop and her work. The rapid rattle of her typing served as the music that played the office interloper off the stage of her attention and out of her day. Their time for speeches had run out. 

Dr Douglas Hamish left with a smile and as he closed the office door on his pragmatic friend and colleague, he reminded her there was a meeting in an hour and that lunch with the director of the department was straight after. She grunted in reply a moment before the door latched.

Like it or not, she was going to be on the Preservation Project. 

\*  *  *

“So. You think there’s any donuts in there?” 

Hamish noted a few confused whispers, but no reaction from the project lead: Dr Emily Carlisle. The pair were stood with the others of her hand-picked team in an observation room, deep below ground in a facility in which they had been living for eight months. The day of the discovery they had been brought here...for security reasons, ostensibly, and had not yet been permitted to leave or have any non-monitored communication with the outside world. 

Now, at last, some progress. It was here. A wall of glass lay between them and the discovery that had swiftly moved their project underground, an object that had become known only as The Capsule.

It had taken eight months to get it here. Eight months of frantic, clandestine work to dig it up and get it back to Earth. All the while the team had wondered: what would be so bad about letting the world know what they had found?

Carlisle’s eyes stayed on the impossibly black, coffin-sized object, undistracted by her colleagues in the room or the orange hazmatted figures beyond the glass that prodded, measured, and probed. 

The Capsule had been found on the Moon at Preservation Site Delta, a location that was backup of a backup, merely one of several possible places in which humanity would bury its collective consciousness. Initially, the object was assumed to be debris from some previous mission or a lost lunar experiment. 

But it quickly proved to be less Earthly in origin. The Capsule had form and mass, but no other details could be divined. To almost every scan and measurement: it appeared to not exist. No thermal output or reflection. No energy escaped its surface.

And it just happened to be buried right where chance had forced their hand, so that a career interupting, time-sink of a project could be completed. A project that amounted, in Dr Carlisle’s opinion, to be nothing more than graffiti on our nearest, non-world, celestial body. 

Human’s were ‘ere. Whoopty-doo. 

And then. This.

The inflated, orange, plastic-armoured, apes poked, prodded and waved wands that crackled and beeped. 

What was it made of? 

What is it’s purpose? 

And how had this undetectable object end up exactly where they would look?

Perhaps, she thought, I have been to harsh on the Preservation Project. Maybe the purpose isn’t the answers that we bury, but the questions that they’ll raise.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
