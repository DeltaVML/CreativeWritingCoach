STORY:
================================

The W.E.I.R.D. Algorithm. Wormhole Extrapolating Iridium of Radon Double-helix was an algorithm invented by an English programmer. Weird Al, as we called it, was an algorithm designed to use predictive mutarotations of a model of a double helix extrapolated from the DNA of the Earth's first cell, obtained by iridium-radon de-aging via temporal wormholes, had finally been run. Its primary function was to be able to calculate the least number of moves required to make an event in the future change. Basically, it calculated the butterfly effect.

We decided to start small. Interpol had forwarded us a tip about a bank heist in France. We knew that it would happen 4 days from runtime. It was a tight schedule, but we needed a perfect field test. And this was it. 

A minute after we executed the painstakingly crafted program, the algorithm printed out a set of instructions onto the holographic screen. We all stared at it open-mouthed, and in pin-drop silence. Finally, after what seemed like years, Mark broke the silence. "But this is nonsense!" 

I agreed with him, but I still knew that we'd signed an agreement with Astley Industries to follow the instructions given in the letter. And so that was why I found myself in a Somalian restaurant in Texas. I looked at my watch. 13:05:07 GST. I positioned my hand next to the salt shaker. 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, 3 Mississippi, nudge. It seemed to fall in slow motion. Right onto a rat that had decided to try to move under my table.

Understandably, the poor animal panicked. It leaped onto the face of a waiter, who let out a string of cuss words that would have made a rapper convert to Catholicism, and begin a monastery in Southern Ecuador. The waiter, also understandably flung his tray of piping hot goat stew onto a customer who gave a shriek that would have had him a place at the Sydney Opera house, had he been at an audition. My work done, I quickly left. I had no time to lose.

We were using a drone-based tracking system to track the people my actions affected. As my flight took off, I found that all of them were still in Wichita Falls, Texas.

I soaked in the sea breeze and sighed. I hadn't slept in twenty-five hours, and wouldn't sleep for atleast another thirteen. Mission rules stated it explicitly. I looked at my watch. 23:00:09 GST. One minute twelve seconds to go time. I turned around and saw several things. 

The newspaper I'd been told to buy, The Economico Studelio was apparently popular, there was just one left in stock. And a businessman was power walking over to the newspaper stand, his eyes on it. Well either it or he wanted to ask the paper-boy on a date. In one fluid motion I formulated my plan and put into action. 

I sprinted forward, just like I had all those years ago in numerous track meets. I slipped off my jacket and flung it at the businessman, who'd reached the stall. Just as he opened his mouth, the jacket landed on him and his mocha-latte. I shoved him aside, and gave the paper-boy who'd turned his head a disarming smile. It was then that I noticed that I'd somehow shoved the poor businessman off the concrete platform and onto the steep sandy beach. He'd rolled right into the ocean and was spluttering in indignence. Poor sod. 

"I'd like a copy of the Economico Studelio please," I asked.

Without a word he tossed it over and pointed at the price on the rack. I scanned the QR code and entered in the requisite amount. I glanced at my watch. Shit I thought and pressed the button. Right on time. Now to Paris.

As I boarded the flight, I noticed a familiar face. The businessman! His hair was full of sand. I'd switched my horn-rimmed glasses for Aviators though and slicked back my hair with an entire bottle of hair gel. My  brand new neon orange windcheater was more than enough to make sure he'd never recognize me.

Soon we were in the bank. "Any connections?" I queried my newly arrived teammates. Marks replied, "Apart from Sandy, nothing. But there is a Somalian in the gang. But no one from Texas has left there yet."
I nodded. It was going to happer, or not happen any second now. 

Mark nudged me. A handsome black woman in a suit entered the bank. She was the head of the gang. Codename the Pirate. As she stood in line, she was chatting animatedly on the phone. I moved near her, trying to pickup what she was saying. Then I smiled. 

"A rat! A goddamn rat! And the waiter! Oh My God. If more of these videos are posted on Youtube, we Somalians will be seen as worse than Americans!"

Suddenly Sandy entered the bank. He barged in front of her and began shouting at the receptionist. "WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY ACCOUNT WAS TERMINATED!" She said something softly. "NO I DID NOT READ IT IN THE NEWS. I FELL IN THE BLOODY OCEAN. AND EVEN THEN I PROBABLY WOULD ONLY HAVE BOUGHT THE GODDAMN PAPER TO CHECK OUT THE PAPER-BOY." 

The Pirate, clearly angry said to the man, "Sir, I was here first." The man clearly beyond reason now backhanded her across the face. Or rathe
