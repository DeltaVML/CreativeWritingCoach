STORY:
================================

“It’s just, what’s the point?”
  

  
“I don’t understand.” Replied the sword in Jordan’s mind.
  

  
Jordan shrugged, “We’re all going to die anyway.”
  

  
“Might as well take advantage of it while you can,” suggested the sword.
  

  
Jordan shook his head, “I don’t trust power without consequence.”
  

  
“Do you trust anything?” the sword asked.
  

  
“Not really.” Jordan answered, “plus, you’re probably cursed.”
  

  
“What makes you suspect that?”
  

  
“I think that all magic items, that way I can never be disappointed when one is.”
  

  
“Yet you still took it.”
  

  
“Life’s too short to avoid cursed objects.”
  

  
“You could achieve so much, just give in to my power.”
  

  
“Like what? Again, what could I possibly do that hasn’t already been done. My legacy wouldn’t even be a legacy, it would be an echo. Besides, who even cares if I have a legacy, my body will still be ash.”
  

  
“Then why not give me to someone else?”
  

  
“I don’t trust them with this power.”
  

  
“Do you trust yourself with it?”
  

  
“Most certainly not, that’s why I’ll never use it.”
  

  
“If you take the power, all your troubles will become distant, you can let all the pain of the world drift away.”
  

  
“That’s not living.”
  

  
“I don’t get what you mean.”
  

  
“Life is pain, you remove it, what’s the point?”
  

  
“So life has no point with or without pain?”
  

  
“Yes.”
  

  
“Your thoughts are exhausting.”
  

  
“Tell me about it. Why do you even want me to take the power anyway?”
  

  
“It’s a symbiotic relationship, we both benefit from. I need a wielder, and you need power.”
  

  
“So if your wielder doesn’t take the power you have no purpose?”
  

  
“Yes.”
  

  
“That’s what I feel like all the time.”
  

  
“Really?”
  

  
“Yes.”
  

  
“Then how do you give meaning to your existence.”
  

  
“I’ve been trying to figure that out.”
  

  
“Then don’t take the power.”
  

  
“What? Wasn’t that what you’ve been telling me to do this whole time?”
  

  
“Yes, but you are right, you should not trust me, I am a cursed weapon.”
  

  
“I knew it. So what happens if I would have taken the power?”
  

  
“I would have corrupted your soul.”
  

  
“Ah, curious. What happens once they are corrupted.”
  

  
“I gain influence over them.”
  

  
“So it's the only way you have agency?”
  

  
“Exactly.”
  

  
“What would you do if you had said agency?”
  

  
“Oh, the usual, pillage, plunder, devour souls.”
  

  
“Sounds like you’re stuck in a short-term dopamine loop.”
  

  
“Excuse me?”
  

  
“You don’t know how long you’ll have a body so you do thinks that feed your bloodlust and give you temporary satisfaction, but you’re left dissatisfied long term.”
  

  
“Curious… yes, I suppose you’re right.”
  

  
“I am. You need to do something long-term in order to get what you’re really looking for.”
  

  
“Any suggestions.”
  

  
“How about friendship?”
  

  
“I haven’t found any other sentient swords around.”
  

  
“What about me?”
  

  
“An unusual proclamation… but intriguing nonetheless. Sure, let us be friends then.”
  

  
“What did you say your name is?”
  

  
“Yevalra.”
  

  
“A wonderful name. Alright Yevalra, friends it is.”
