STORY:
================================

The long con...  

Al Yankovic was smarter than all of us.  Heck, we thought his genius was 'limited' to song parodies.  He proved us all so wrong.  Turns out, his song parody skills were complete rubbish to his real skills.  He was the most skilled programmer probably ever.  He had played us all.

While he was developing parody songs, he was also learning the algorithms of how the human brain processed language on multiple levels.  He worked these out when he was a boy listening to Dr. Demento.  He wrote out flow charts in notebooks.  His archives now have pages and pages of them digitized for us to pour through.   Once he got his first computer, his self discovery rocketed.  

On his deathbed, Weird Al set off a broadcast where he told the world what he had been working on, and where it would go.  He was going to save humanity.  He would do it with...

Weird Al, would transform into Weird A.I.

His Avatar would continue to make parody songs for generations, but he was also working out how to repair our planet.  But, if we weren't laughing while we did it, what was the point?

(sure it's short... I lost focus.  However, I wish this so badly to be true, because Weird Al is absolutely one of the best of humanity.)
