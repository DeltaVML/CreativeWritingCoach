STORY:
================================

The stinking smell of alcohol, inaudible whispers and screams of electronic devices flooded my senses. A woman in medical mask and milk white uniform tapped several air bubbles out of a syringe. As she came close to me, giving me reassuring whispers like those across the room, I closed my glassy eyes and my mind wandered to several months before.

This time, all I could hear is clicking and typing sounds.

"Sun?"

I stopped my hands on the keyboards, and glanced swiftly beside my desk. It was Rey the Gnome, who was holding papers higher than her head and with a box of documents beside her. And...she was my superior officer.

"Well—" she massaged her temples and her gushy brows contracted into a terrible frown. "I know that you are hard-working and to be honest, you are one of the best salesmen in my department."

"Thank you."

"But you are, how can I smooth it out? Unremarkable. You see? We sell Brooms for people to travel safely and Cartas for quick messages, but you can't perform any of this. HR has already requested a transfer of YOU to the Unremarkable Department."

"Please madam, I am sure there's another way." I sprang up to my feet, feeling blood rushing to my temples. People often labelled me as Unremarkable, Incapable, Broken and Failure. I spent more than half of my life proving myself, shifting jobs to jobs, seeking promotions and finally, landed to a normal life. 

This cannot be the end of my life.

"And what is a normal life?" She bitterly smiled.

Gnomes that were certified with Grade 9 could mind-read for a brief time, yet I didn't see that coming. My gaze descended to the ground, because deep in my heart I knew that day of falling down would always come. My fantasy of living, pretending to be a normal person would always burst into bubble. It was simply a matter of time. I packed my stuff in silence and briskly left the department. 

"Welcome to Floor UG113." A small piece of blackboard with milk white handwriting stood quietly at the corner. The golden lift raise up and I was left inside a dark corridor. 

"Hello?" My voice echoed and twisted into a deep voice.

Someone clicked a switch, and the light bulbs along the corridor began to blink. They radiated a warm, subtle glow and unveiled the identity of the lighter.

"Ames!" I couldn't believe my own eyes, as he was not only my best friend in college but also a missing ones. He went missing several years ago. His parents and I searched for him with no hope, the cops wouldn't cooperate and his company didn't answer. I thought...we lost him.

"I have been waiting for you here for many days. Well, what is today's date?" He whispered.

"7th of May. Why are you whispering? What happened to you? Your parents and I—"

He put a finger on his mouth, and I lowered my voice. His left arm was attached to a Vacutainer, which I shuddered with the sight of it as his arm was bruised because of it.

"Follow me."

As we walked along the corridor, I gazed with sharp nerves. Not long after, I began to realize that the walls were actually made with raven black plastic sheets, and outside the corridor laid more than thousands of hospital beds. He led me to an empty bed and we sat side by side, while being surrounded by an immeasurable amount of beds. Some with people, some without. 

I glanced up and the ceiling was unseen as there was not enough illuminance provided by the light bulbs, which were fading away as the switch restored its original spot.

"This is where all the 'Unremarkables' come." He said.

"Oh shush."

"No, I'm not labelling us." Although the room was dimly lit, I could feel he clenched his eyes, as if withstanding an unbearable pain. "You know we can never fit in this society right?"

"I know." My voice cracked, head's down and heart ached.

"That's why I am here. This is a secret project associated with every guild, race...People gain freedom, privileges and happiness from magic, but many of them suffer as well. It could create the strongest nation, but it could also brew wars. Yet—" He coughed. "We, have the power to heal those who are innocent."


"But this isn't fair." I shook my head. 

"The test can cultivate a serum that can save everyone."

"Saving everyone by costing your life???"

His faced darkened.

"I shouldn't even be here."

When I tousled my head, a woman in white clenched my neck and injected a steamy hot liquid in me. The syringe still glowed with the remaining liquid, dropped to the floor and bounced off, making a clinging sound. All I could grasp was the feeling of falling on the bed, handcuffs on both of my wrists attached to it and a Vacutainer was inserted into my left arm.

A feeling of purpose flooded my chest, the ache gone away like wind in the early Spring. The screams and beeping sounds of a medically machine woke me up. 

"What is today's date?" 

Note: Opening scene was inspired by the Matrix, the setting was less fantasized then I intended but I'm just too tired to change it back. Decided to end it as a psycholo
