I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I'm weird.  No. Strange?  who the fuck cares?  How about not normal?  But then again what's normal these days?  I'm asking too much.  Am I asking too much?  

All I know is that one day it started talking.  A lot of folks would have a hard time believing such a thing, and when confronted with empirical evidence you'd think they're that one dude who killed that other dude for freeing him in that greek story about the cave.  

Anyway, I awoke as I do most mornings, generally afraid of leaving my bed for the discomfort.  Apart from the air conditioning, the news talking shit, and the slavery I so modestly called employment - I was not a very social person.  Seeing another human being was kind of a drag,  because it always seemed that such an encounter would always lead to some unnecessary social interreaction.  Especially, if there wasn't some apparent benefit. 

"What's up sugar tits?"  

I must have been asleep, because as much as I felt that the voice was real, I must have been dreaming.  As a retired LSD connoisseur and tour guide, I was familiar with auditory hallucinations and where you might find them.  And surely, my killer would have to be either stupid or paranormal to think I am a worthy piece of ass.  

" You would not believe the shit you did last night."

Yep. Dreaming.  Back to sleep.  

I had to pee.  Peeing in the morning is the true meaning of life.  A wife, kids, tasty food, and beverages.  I don't want it if I can't relieve myself in the morning, only to fall back asleep.  Pooping is alright.  But it requires alot more than peeing.  Fuck wiping.  

Shutting the bathroom door,  I leaned in over the toilet to compensate the trajectory of my stream.  What can I say?  The shorter it is, the harder to aim.  Especially with morning wood.  

It was at that moment I met Murphy for the first time.  You hear about Sigma males that name their penis, but I hopefully am the only one whose penis told me it's name.

" What's up bitch? "

What I thought was my urethra turned out to be a mouth, that started to piss on my face - much like a jock would make you a wedgie.  

"What the fuck?!" I exclaimed as I tried to wipe my own urine off my face.

Laughing maniacly it quoted the Exorcist " Do you know what she did?  Your cuntting daughter?"  

Disturbed, I heard a desperate knocking @ the door.  "Rich, you gotta get out here man."  

Collecting myself and opening the door, I saw what I had been too groggy to see before.  Half the house was missing.  " Look man," Joe said, " I don't know what's going on but you got alot of explaining to do."

The street was lined with armored vehicles and it seemed as though people were rioting.  The military helicopters flew down above what was left of ms house.  

" Rich!  Rich!  Hey!  Riiich!"  I could hear my dick cry out.  

"WHAT?!" I yelled down looking annoyed.  

My dick chuckled looking at me smiling and all he said was "Hi."
