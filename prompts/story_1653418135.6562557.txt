STORY:
================================

“Hey phil” *oh hey its bob* thought phil, not taking in what really just happened he just said “hey bob, hows the kids?”. “Oh theyre dead, died 216 years ago”. Quite unfortunate, thought phil, man what a good friend bob is, always has ben such an exuberent funny feller. Shame he hasnt seem in so long. “So what brings you here?” Phil said as he lugged his way back to his house, setting a large duffle bag on the steps to sit next to Bob on the porch. “Oh nothing much, heard a band was playing here- thought i’d see it” oh yeah thats right, the cockroaches, His favorite band. Not as good as the street performers that played years ago, but pretty alright for the current time. “Huh..that’s cool, how long are you planning on staying” Phil said more quietly, still not taking in the fact his friend is still alive.

“Oh uhm. Probably just a few days, yeah, got to get back to my home town, can never leave there for too long” said Bob, blissfully enjoying the day around him, almost swaying his legs on the rocking chair of the, old prairie house. “Oh cool! We should do something then while you’re here..hold on. Shouldn’t you be dead? Why are you still, alive?” Phil begin to ponder snd stare at him in wonder and confusion, Bob however just looked at him and did a little reasurring smile “what do you mean? Weve only ben friends for 2 years”. At this point Phil stood up and backed up a few steps “what are you talking about. Ive met you 100’s of years ago. You shouldn’t be talking to me”. Bob looked at Phil dead on, and casually said happily with a chuckle “Phil, what are you on about? All our friend groups still alive, theyre all in the house. Just like you put us there” 

Phil began to descent into panic, as he started to tremble “no. No no no no, you guys werent suppose to be alive, i know you shouldnt.All of you died! All of you i-“ Bob stepped towards him, one step at a time “then why did you put us in your house? Were there every day arent we. You did this”. Bob said in a cold. Emotionless tone, staring at Phil. The past warmth of his body now gone, replaced by a stinging aching feeling inside Phils body “Go. Leave me alone.” 

Phil turned away from the wall, Bob now mysteriously dissapeared, Phil notices a gaping hole in his body, as the blood starts seeping through him he faints. Only to come to consciousness next morning in his bed, with the wound fully healed.

Looking around his prarie house room, he stretched before getting out of his bed, and walking out of his room past objects covered in tarp. Getting into the kitchen he grabs a cup of coffee, before greeting his other friend “…good morning Marvin”. Marvin does nothing but stay completely still, un moving and pale in his sight. Phil walks around to sit on his couch. Next to two of his other, taxedermized friends next to him, as Bob’s lifeless body sits frozen in place across from him. Phil turns on the tv. “Just another day.”
