STORY:

Healer: Alright, here … we … go.

Patient: Achoo!

Healer: Ah … I missed.

A black sigil forms underneath the patient.

Healer: Back up!

The Healer forcefully pulls back the patient’s wife. A white gooey substance manifests from the sigil and begins absorbing the patient.

Wife: Edward! Oh my God! Edward! NO! Stop!

Edward: Fuck! Shit! If I die, I swear to god. Ohhh what a good fucking healer you were! Penelope! Spread the word; make sure this healer is fucked over because of this! Ah fuck! Ah FUCK! Fuck you damn it! Fuck y-

The white substance fully envelopes Edward and continues to grow out of the black sigil. Penelope screams out in fear.

The white goo begins taking on the form of a sphere. It grows out strange stems, much like antennaes. The outer surface shifts from smooth to rough and flakey as the bottom of the sphere forms and leaves the sigil.

For a moment, the strange form floats there above the bed with Edward floating in the middle … and suffocating from a lack of air.

Penelope: What’s happening? What’s happening?! SAVE HIM!

Healer: Yeah, I’m sorry. There isn’t really anything I can do.

Edward’s clothes and skin then begin to fray and dissolve into goo around him … leaving him writhing in agony. 

Penelope: Edward! 

Healer: Wait! Don’t approach!

Penelope reaches out as the Healer attempts to hold her back. Penelope breaks free and charges. She tries to reach into the form and grab her husband. The onset of pain, much like from acid burning away at your skin, instantly overwhelms her. Penelope screams out in pain.

Very quickly her focus shifts from saving her husband to saving herself. But she cannot pull out her arm. The form is pulling her in. 

Edward is panicking very frantically. Very little of his clothes remain, same for his skin. His panicking suddenly slows … and ceases after a couple jolts. 

Penelope’s arm and shoulder has been completely sucked in, and her skin is fraying.

Penelope: PULL ME OUT! Pull me out-te-

She whimpers from the pain.

Healer: I can’t … I‘ll get sucked in myself.

Penelope: PLEASE!

Healer: What I can do … is this.

The healer pulls out a pistol, and points it and Penelope’s head.

Healer: I apologize, but I did say to stop moving.

Penelope: No! Wai-

The Healer fires. Penelope’s body goes limp, hanging from her submerged arm and is slowly pulled into the white form. 

The Healer shakes her head and sighs in disappointment. 

She then looks at Edward. His skin is completely gone, and his muscle has begun to fray. His disfigured face horrifies her … specifically the eyes. It looked as though his irises had been torn off. She decides to leave rather than observe … even it means losing an opportunity to understand her spell better.

She leaves the room to find a child waiting outside … maybe 3 or 4 years old.

Healer: He… hello.

Silence from the child.

Healer: Ugghhhhh, fuck! Alright, let’s go.

She grabs the kid and drags him outside away from the room. The child strangely offers little resistance. He looks back at the room where he heard screams and then at the lady in front of him and decides to let himself be dragged away. 

Healer: Listen here child. Your parents have died. You need someone to take care of you, yes? I will take care of you. Do not give me trouble.
