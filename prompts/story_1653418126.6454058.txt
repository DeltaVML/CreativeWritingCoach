I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

It started out as a normal morning, you wake up at 5:30, get ready, grab something eat and you’re off to go to your job at the office. Except one thing…you’re sixteen years old again, and get this notification on your phone *warning, the simulation has a rip in it and your civilian will be experiencing age regressions…please remain calm as we are fixing the problem. Have a nice day*. 

Great, just when I thought Monday couldn’t get it any worse. My boss was a ten year old annoying little kid and my coworkers were various ages and wore clothes from when they were that age so it looked like an episode out of the office at my job today. 

I even had to discipline my boss, yeah thought I would have to do that…ever. Right now, some of my coworkers are crying because they are babies, some of them are playing beer pong because they are college students and others want ice cream or candy because they are children. 

I look at the clock and see it’s only 12…”this is going to be a longgg day”. I say as I helped give a bottle to my supervisor.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
