STORY:

Most parents develop their kids fear very early on, taking extra care with specialists not to traumatize them too much. My parents didn't want to inflict such pain upon me, they couldn't bring themselves to hurt their baby daughter for the sake of a silly power.

I spent most of my life without a fear, without powers. While in school, I saw most other kids having fun with their powers, some even having surpassed their fears and hesitation.

In high school I was probably the only kid without a power. I had no actual phobias and watching horror movies only made me more desensitized to them. I was a bit jealous, seeing my friend pass through doors and walls like they didn't exist, but I'd already given up on trying for a power.

I was too late to get a power. Honestly, being older and more rational made it difficult to get scared, let alone an exact phobia. When I did get scared, it wasn't to the point I would develop my ability and it always sucked testing to see if I'd awakened to anything and coming up sort.

In all honesty, I probably didn't even need a good power to get by. My father's power was telekinesis from fear of being controlled and my mother's was electricity from a traumatic event where her brother died when she was young. Their current occupations paid handsomely, and if they ever left, others would flock to grab them before others.

And yet, there was no time I wanted a power more than today. My parents lay dead on the floor, the home invaders having taken them by surprise, and I was lying on the cold floor bleeding out next to them.

Tears kept falling from my eyes, my face opposite to my unmoving mother's. I didn't want to die. I wasn't really scared of death, but I didn't want to die. I was terrified, but I didn't know what terrified me, and I couldn't activate any power whatsoever.

In my shallow breaths, I accepted my end. And at that moment, I saw my father's body twitching as he stood up, telekinesis moving what seemed to be a corpse. Upon landing his gaze on one of the intruders, the man's neck was torn apart.

The others quickly took notice and pelted him with bullets, but not before he took another two with him.

I cried, my voice unable to be heard from the blood blocking my throat. It was all over. I was dying, unable to do anything. I was a failure, always late to do anything in life. Too late to get a power, too late to save my parents, too late to warn them that someone had broke in.

Being so close to dying, I wasn't scared of meeting my end. No, perhaps that would be a blessing. What I was terrified of, was that I would be too late to meet my parents in the same afterlife, that I would be late one more time and eternal rest would become eternal hell.

My eyes closed for the last time, a tear rolling down my face as I felt my power activating for the first time.

I was terrified.

My eyes shot open, the pain I felt before I died gone, as were all the injuries. I took a quick look at my surroundings, finding myself tucked in my bed.

Terror gave way to confusion, to surprise and then to hope. I opened my phone which was luckily right next to me. The date was Saturday, 2:39 am, and everyone was asleep. Muffled footsteps were heard from downstairs and my hope turned into terror back again.

I turned my head, finding a person dressed in black with whiffs of smoke coming from his clothes. I only had enough time to look the home invader in the eyes before pulled a gun from his pocket and shot me.

With a gasp, I opened my eyes again, this time immediately jumping up from bed. The noise seemed to have alerted the intruders, however, as they made their way to my bedroom only seconds later, ending my life without hesitation.

I grunted as I opened my eyes again, knowing just how bad the situation was. But this time I wasn't scared. I calmly got out of bed.

My power defied reality and no matter how many attempts it took, no matter how many times I died, I would survive, and I would save my parents.

I wasn't scared of pain, I had already died twice.

My parents were still alive.

I wasn't late. I wasn't going to be late. Not this time, not any time, not going forward.

Because my ability answered to my deepest fear, and I wasn't going to allow myself to be late ever again.
