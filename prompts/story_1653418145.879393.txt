STORY:
================================

"Yeah I've met Julius Caesar. Helluva guy. Ever heard the story of how he was captured by pirates? Well, they took him and he gave 'em a verbal ass-whoopin' over the fact that he deemed their ransom amount to be too low for someone of his stature. The ransom was paid and he was freed. Then, he got an army, came back, and had them all crucified. Fuckin' brutal. I'd know- I was there. Swear to God!"

The man talking in such a fashion was Mr. Sander, our new history teacher at Melancholia High School. He had invited students, faculty, and anyone else who wanted to come to his house for a "welcome to the city" party. Ultimately, more people showed up than expected. Mr. Sander had sat down with a group of students and started to talk, eventually getting down to a bunch of historical stories. The two things that were learned about Mr. Sander were that: 1) he was very eccentric and flamboyant (one might even call him 'odd' or 'a character') and 2) he had no filter. It was looking to be a fun year.

After Mr. Sander finished his Julius Caesar story, there was a moment of silence as everyone waited for the excitement to die down. Suddenly, Mr. Sander yawned. "Goddamn! I didn't realize it was that late already. I'm gonna go get me some coffee." He got himself up out of his seat and over to the table where the coffee was served, and as he did so, the energy could practically be felt leaving the table. 

The kids looked at each other. "Well, he's an interesting guy" was pretty much the sentence repeated around the table. It was certainly said in a positive way, which was practically the best you could hope for from kids of this age towards a potential teacher. After a few minutes Mr. Sander made his way back to the table with his coffee, where it was obvious that he seemed to be in a better mood than before. He sat down in his seat, set his cup down, and took a deep breath. "Now, where were we?"

There was a crash behind them. They all looked in the general direction of the sound to see that shattered glass covered the floor near the food table. Someone had hit something accidentally, causing a domino effect and disaster for the helpers. Mr. Sander sighed and got up. "Ladies and gentlemen, we'll have to continue this in a few minutes. I'll be right back". He sauntered off in the direction of the mess.

That was when the late hour started to hit the kids; another domino effect occurred in which one kid yawned, and then another, to the point where, soon, all of them were practically asleep. One of the kids, the one closest to Sander's seat, looked at his coffee cup enviously. He decided that he was going to take a sip, so he leaned in, grabbed it, and tilted it towards his head. 

He only drank a little bit, but that sip was marvelous. It seemed to fill his entire body. More than that, it not only filled his body, but his mind as well. He felt completely awake again. Most of the kids were looking at him. *I wonder how it tasted. He looks completely new, almost like a completely different person.* The kid sat up, looked at the girl who had spoken and said, "It's great. It's like no other coffee I've ever tasted; it certainly doesn't smell like it. I don't even know how to describe it." He looked up, to find that the girl was looking at him kind of funny. "What?" he asked her. The girl replied with, "Why did you just say that?" Now it was his turn to feel confused. The girl continued, "You were talking to me, yeah? I swear to god, I didn't say anything. The question that you answered did cross my mind, though. That was so weird." Now they both looked horrified. *Shit. Shit! Am I hearing people's thoughts?!* Now, he was more than awake. He felt like he might have a panic attack.

*You know, it's not polite to take other people's things.*

Practically jumping out of his seat, the kid turned around to see Mr. Sander, back from his humanitarian aid. The teacher stared at him, knowingly. He motioned to the cup. The kid shoved the coffee cup into the teacher's outstretched hands, and Sanders responded with a jovial remark. "I appreciate you not spilling any of it while jumping around like that," he said with a smile. He sat himself back in his seat. "Now, hopefully we aren't interrupted again." The kids were all upbeat and leaning forward again, as if they had never needed the coffee in the first place. *What is going on?* the kid thought. Sanders looked over at him, and he could swear that the teachers' eyes started to glow. They started to glow and then they glowed even brighter, as if signifying his growing fury. Then, it was out as if it had never happened. The kid came to a horrifying realization. *Fuck! I'm not even safe in my own head, am I?*

*No.*

The kid, barely containing himself, muttered something about going to the bathroom, jumped up, and ran off.

*Were you being serious? About having met those people?*

*Did I ever give you any indication that I wasn't?*

*What are you?*

The kid ran around the house. The house
