STORY:
================================

The sun was rising.

The birds were chirping.

And a cat(?) was on the prowl.

All in all the most average of days... except for the white cat(?) muttering to itself as it curled it's noticeably long body past a traffic post, it's beady eyes focused keenly on a group of teenaged children milling around the entrance of the grounds of a high school.

"Finally, finally I've found her!  And still with time to spare, my tracking skills are as perfect as I remember them!" the cat(?) exclaimed in a feminine whisper, grasping one paw into a fist.  She then leaned forward on both paws, observing as the morning bell rang out, and the students haphazardly shuffled past the chainlink fence.  Her tail snaked up into the air, growing ridged as the black-furred tip angled in the direction of the school, gradually turning leftward.

"She's heading toward one of those smaller dwellings... I've got the location down, I'll just come back when the school day is over and try to find her alone."  A sudden door slam behind the cat(?) drew her attention, and she looked back over her shoulder to see two men in some sort of uniform waddling over toward her.

"Looks like a stray, Sam.  Odd breed though," said the taller of the two as he fiddled with the net in his hands.  The rounder of the two glanced down at his phone, and replied. "Well, the call was just about a white cat, nothing much else, Ralph."

Her eyes went wide as she immediately bolted, the tall Ralph right on her heels.

'Oh stars no, I can't let them catch me!' was the only thought in her mind.

"...thus in September when the winged hussars arrived, the allied forces were able to lift the siege of Vienna and..."

The instructor continued his excited droning, as a good number of students in the class paid little attention and occupied themselves with their own distractions.  One boy's distraction was someone else in the class...

'Man, I can't get over how cute she is,' he thought to himself, his sharp eyes transfixed on the pigtailed girl two rows further up in the classroom.  Suddenly he felt a vibration in his pocket; glancing down, he read the text quickly. 'Nate, bro, are you checking out the freshman girl again lol'

Nate sent a quick, succinct reply: 'stfu Luis'

'eyyy lmao me too'

The period passed by oddly fast; for some reason, Nate would swear he could hear the faint whispers of the waves at sea.  That or it was just the wind, but even as he left class, he couldn't shake that odd feeling.

"Oh my stars, I can't... huff... believe I had to use... pant... my magic to get away from those guys..."

The mystery cat(?) had returned to the school after a long adventure.  Not only had she had to escape the animal shelter workers, but then there was that dog... and then that kid with the gum... and then the angry alley cats... and then that crazy blonde who kept calling her Artemis... and then the kid with the gum again but with friends!

Finally she had had to expend some of her limited magic reserve to effectively flashbang her way out of the mess.  And the worst part was now she was behind schedule!

Running onto the school grounds, the cat(?) had her tail up straight, the tip bent slightly, as she honed in on the magic signature she had been following initially that led her to the school.

'The dimensional wave is about to break!  I gotta find her before the beast comes through into this world!'

The cat(?) dashed around the corner as the sky started to change color to a murky purple...

[[[

"Alright I'll see ya tomorrow then at practice Nate."

"Later Luis, I'll be there!"

The two friends parted ways, as Nate meandered around a bit, not in any particular hurry to go home.  Instead he spotted the pigtailed girl off in the distance, as she walked with two other girls out the other end of the courtyard.  Naturally, he followed.

"This is kinda stalkerish... well, I won't follow any further than the edge of the school grounds."

Even saying that, he couldn't keep his eyes off the tantalizing edge of her skirt as it fluttered about with every step she took.  So entranced was he, that he didn't notice the cat barging around the corner until he had nearly tripped over it.

"Holy shit!  What the??"

"Wait, you're not??"

Before it could even register that the cat(?) had just TALKED, there was a crack of thunder as the blue sky had turned purple, and a black rift tore through space.  Through it came out what could only be described as a super-sized ogre made of hazy black ether with shards of purple crystals jutting out of its shoulders and back.  On its face rested a single giant red eye, but with no eyesocket as the eye traveled freely across the surface of its face to scan the surroundings.

"What the ever loving shit is that!?"

"It's a beast of alternate dimension!  BAD for short!"

Nate finally looked down at the white cat(?) as it finally clicked.

"Whoa hold on... I'm clean, so I can't be hallucinating this.  Okay.  You're an alien cat."

She shook he
