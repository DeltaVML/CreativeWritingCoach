STORY:
================================

It was an exciting discovery, at first.

Our ancestors were speaking to us!  Not literally our ancestors (we came from a different evolutionary branch), but still.  Our Terran cousins.  Brothers from other mothers.  Earth-alikes.

The discovery quickly turned out to be...perhaps less 'breathtaking' and more 'odd'.

There was, for example, not a single piece of evidence that they had any major technology we lacked.  They'd buried an ancient computer at a time when they were, apparently, at more or less exactly the same level of technology we were at.  There were a few things we had that they didn't, and a few puzzling engineering problems that they'd provided the answers to, but we weren't learning anything terribly impressive by copying their technology.

The *real* value of the discovery was two-fold.  Two points of data that were entirely perplexing- the discovery was valuable less for the answers it provided, than because of the questions it provoked.

The deeper mystery, and objectively the more important one, was the fact that the species before us had very obviously not lasted all that long after leaving their archive on the moon.  They had listed future plans of theirs, including regular new moon archives, with a list of candidate locations.

There was nothing, in those locations or anywhere else.

The second puzzle was, all but certainly, less important.  It was also the one that dominated the news, dominated the academic discussions, lead to everyone and their dog having their own, competing hypotheses as to *why*.

We'd been prepared for a massive linguistic puzzle.  Their archive had a display screen, and we'd been prepared for a massive effort to decode their instructions, and work to decipher the futuristic knowledge from the past contained within the archive.

But our ancestors wrote in English.

Full-blown, modern English.  The spelling on a few words was different, and there were a handful of slang words that we had to identify from context, but the species that had ascended to the stars before us spoke (or, at least, *wrote*) English, all but identical to our own.

Their name for our shared planet was Erth.

It was objectively freaky.  Was there some sort of psychic resonance within the planet?  Some fundamental linguistic rule that drew languages in that direction?  Sheer coincidence?

Everyone had guesses, and no one had answers.

The more we learned about them, the more mysterious things became.  They were reptilian.  They had scales, and tails, and no trace of hair.  They laid eggs (though they definitely engaged in parenting as well).  The main traits we had in common with them were opposable thumbs and bipedalism (the latter being only an occasional thing for our distant predecessors- their archive suggested that they preferred moving on all fours, and only stood upright when they had to carry something).

They didn't even have vocal cords as we understood them- they made sounds by rubbing their thumbs against each other, or against special pads on their throats or tails.  There was an audio recording, and their language sounded *nothing* like English.

It was a mystery.

We puzzled, and pondered, and managed, for the most part, to forget entirely about the *real* mystery.  They had gone somewhere, probably not anywhere good, and their similarity to us meant that there was a very real chance that we would go the same way.  Our survival likely hinged on our understanding of this other, deeper mystery.

But curiosity, powerful and helpful though it is, needs direction to reach its full potential.  Direction that we lacked.  There were plenty of people trying to solve the greater mystery, but the bulk our resources were unavailable.  After all, we didn't *know* that something bad had happened to them, and even if we *did*, that wasn't proof that it would happen to *us*.

We had become fixated on the wrong mystery.  We had nerd-sniped ourselves.

Perhaps that is one of the great filters, the barriers to large-scale space exploration that prevent space from being choked with great empires, as Earth so often was.  The ability to not only do great mental feats, but to *direct* your mental energy, prioritize and make difficult choices.

We had learned that an unknown doom hung over our heads, and we were entirely consumed with solving a linguistic puzzle.

So it goes.
