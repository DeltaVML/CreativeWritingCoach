STORY:
================================

Taking a deep breath I stare at my son in the eyes. This has been a common occurrence in the past few days.

Bringing my hands up I hold back all my frustrations as best as I can and I say. "Zhang sweetie. I know it's important to practice your morning meditations and all-"

"It's called Ki practice mom!" He said in an angry voice coming from all four directions interrupting me at the same time.

Nodding I get down to his eye level and smile. He's not my real son but I love him as if he was my actual kid.

Smiling I grabbed his arms as gently as I could. "Zhang, can you please make your friends...go away?" I asked kindly.

In his face I could see displeasure forming all my frustration melted as concern welled up inside of me. "Look sweetie mommy's not used to having the world's most special boy...at least not yet"

"You hate me" Zhang said in a monotone voice.

Opening my mouth I didn't know what to say. But those words made me question if I was a good mother.

"Sweetie, come on I'll make you some pudding. You want chocolate or vanilla?" I asked as I forced myself to smile.

Almost immediately his face brightened up as his black eyes became so full of life and energy. "Chocolate, chocolate!" He began singing as he smiled.

"Hahaha alright chocolate pudding just for my little boy" standing I made my way out of his room. Downstairs I spotted his double who vanished into thin air.

Every step I descended I could listen to Zhang's tinny steps as they followed right behind me.

"Cho-co-late, pu-din!" He began singing as he followed me into the kitchen.

"Wanna help mommy prepare the pudding?" I asked as I gazed at him from over my shoulder.

"Yeah!" He said happily as he ran towards the counter. "Hold your horses, safety first" reaching into the cabinet I take out some gloves and an apron.

Making sure he puts everything on I begin putting my own gloves and apron.

"Let's get to it sweetie!" I say as I begin gathering the ingredients.

Zhang, a boy with special powers. When he was a baby his mother passed away in an accident and his father was nowhere to be found. He was raised at an orphanage.

I have tried to have kids of my own but so far it's always failed. An old friend of mine told me about Zhang and how he had a tragic past.

I was heartbroken to hear his story, but I was not prepared for when he first arrived. A boy with super powers.

At first I managed to convince him not to use his powers outside. But as he got used to living with me he began to actively use it even at school.

I had been approached by government agents who have gave me orientation on my boys power. But no one understands.

I'm just a single mother taking care of a super kid.

"Mommy..." Blinking I don't remember when we finished the pudding or when I began serving his plate.

"Y-yes sweetie?" I asked gathering my thoughts.

"...I'm sorry for what I said" his voice was very low as he lowered his head.

"Zhang..oh baby no" placing the knife on the counter I turned towards my son.

"I know it's hard getting used to...a new life but it's all part of growing up, sometimes you're gonna be happy other times you're gonna be angry" he looked at me with a surprised face.

I couldn't help myself, wrapping my arms around him I was tired and I had a migraine. But my son needed me.

"...what matters the most to me is seeing you being happy, as long as you're happy I'm happy" we stayed like that for a moment just enjoying the warmth of a family hug.

"But if I make you angry?" He asked.

"Well honey, mommy can get angry as well. Stay out of trouble and mommy won't scold you okay?" I asked as I released my little boy from the embrace.

"Okay mom, I'm gonna go play now" he said with such a happy look I just couldn't say no to him.

"Alright, I'll let you know when dinners ready" I said as he took off running to his room.

Once I was alone I sighed and pinched the bridge of my nose. For several minutes I just sat in silence listening as several voices played with toys.

"Mommy he's cheating!" Shouted Zhang from upstairs.

"Patience Mary, he's your responsibility" I mumbled as I stood up and began fixing our dinner.

"Mommy! He's cheating!" Screamed Zhang

"Shut up!" Said the other Zhang's.

"Behave yourself Zhang or you're going 1 week with no tv" I said.

"Noooo!" All four of them screamed from upstairs.
