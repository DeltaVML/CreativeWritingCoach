STORY:
================================

Since I had arrived on Venus, I'd been confused by these humans. They fed exclusively on chemical energy, poor inefficient things, and yet somehow they faced dangers I could only dream of before coming here. Swimming out in the few puddles and lakes not fully treated, riding animals that could crush them without a second thought. Hell, even their closest pets were beasts, and somehow they all looked at me funny when I said I found them frightening. 

There were, though, some things. Some things... that worried me, I'll say. I first encountered it accompanying a flight crew during their final hike of shore leave. Standard activities for them; they'd brought me along in case one of them fell. Not so standard weather.

As the first raindrop hit my body, I thanked the heavens that we were in a terraformed weather zone, as some unused areas of the planet had been left poisonous. The humans didn't absorb moisture through their skin. They even found it unpleasant to be wet, so they went about setting up their umbrellas and raincoats. 

A flash of light drew my attention to the sky in the west over fields of patchy moss. Lightning, a comforting reminder of the planet's heartbeat. I had never seen it on this planet before, but I was glad to share the experience with this crew.

As the first thunderclap hit us, though, someone yelped, jumped, nearly lost his balance. I held out a hand to steady him, and he clung to me like one of the young ones might do to their parent. I looked down at him and back up at the rest of them for an explanation- they were all doing the same to each other, huddled together and shaking in a tight clump. Some of them had this odd blank expression, like they were beyond fear they could express. I got down on the ground and joined them with the human holding on to me, and as I got in close, I could hear someone crying softly. 

"Wha-" I opened my mouth to speak, but it was quickly covered. As the cracks and flashes went on, I did my best to comfort the humans, but each new sound seemed to pull them deeper into their fear. 

After some time, the storm subsided, and the flight crew turned to head home. Nobody spoke on the way back; they seemed ashamed of their fear, as humans often were. I sensed that this was not a good time for questions and I could sate my curiosity later. Even though the storm had been nowhere near hitting, something about it had panicked these hardened soldiers. I could only wonder what might cause such a response... perhaps it was for the best that I didn't know.
