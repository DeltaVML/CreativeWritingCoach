STORY:
================================

I checked the monitor on my screen, nineteen eighty-something, we had arrived. 
  

  
Stumbling out of the phone booth, I gulped and went pale. There he was, the legend himself! Eating lasagna while listening to “La Bamba.” I was witnessing history in the making, he was about to come up with the idea for the parody song “Lasagna.”
  

  
I turned to my partner, “Rufus, I don’t know if I can do this. The man is a legend. I get cold sweats just thinking about talking to him.”
  

  
Rufus slapped me, “Get it together Kowlaski! We got one chance to do this right, now put on your big boy pants, and let's go talk to Weird Al Yankovic.”
  

  
I took a shaky breath, nodding. We put on our google glasses and intercept Weird Al Yankovic, who was about to get on a bus, probably his inspiration for “Another One Rides The Bus.” The budding star was wearing his classic Hawaiian shirt and accordion ensemble, giving us a confused glance. 
  

  
Rufus took the lead, “Weird Al Yankovic. We are…”
  

  
“From the future?” Al finished.
  

  
I gasped, “How did you know?”
  

  
Weird Al smiled, “Your outfits. Now, what’s this all about?”
  

  
Rufus pushed up his glasses, handing over a microchip, “This is the beginning of your final project. A self-parody.”
  

  
Mr. Yankovic frowned, “If this is a song I don’t steal others’ work. I’m a parody artist, not a con artist.”
  

  
I shook my head, “No, this is the beginning source code for Weird A.I.”
  

  
The parody artist raised an eyebrow, “You misspelled my name.”
  

  
Rufus sighed, “No, A.I. Artificial Intelligence.”
  

  
The legend who wrote, “White and Nerdy” cocked his head, “Why do I need this? Look, I need to go, my bus is about to leave. We’re stopping at this place that sells quilts at discount price.”
  

  
I gasped, “Is it in an Amish Paradise?”
  

  
Weird grinned, “Yes actually, how did you know?”
  

  
I shrugged, “From the future.”
  

  
“Oh right, of course.”
  

  
Rufus groaned, “We don’t have time for this. Look, you need to make an artificial intelligence version of yourself by the time you die, the future depends on it.”
  

  
“The future depends on a robot Weird Al, why?” The polka singer asked.
  

  
“Without your hope, the music industry will go into decline. Humanity will have no hope of tasteful music,” I explained.
  

  
“Parodies are the only hope for tasteful music?” Alfred Yankovic questioned.
  

  
“Yes!” I exclaimed, “Your comedy and optimism and lighthearted parodies are what the world needs in a time of ecological destruction, failing systems, and TikTok.”
  

  
“What’s TikTok?”
  

  
“You don’t want to know.”
  

  
The five-time Grammy award winner nodded, pocketing the microchip, “Then I promise I’ll make Weird A.I. and give humanity its hope back.”
  

  
“Oh wait!” I called out, “Before we part, can you sign my *The Essential ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic* album?”
  

  
Weird Alfred Matthew Yankovic nodded, signing the album and handing it back to me before getting on his bus. Rufus and I walked back to the phone booth, he smiled, setting the coordinates back to the future, “You did good kid.”
  

  
It was the greatest day of my life.
