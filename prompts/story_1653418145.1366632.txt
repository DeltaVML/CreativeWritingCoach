I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“No” I said bluntly.

“What?” The man in the black cloak said. I was dragged here by weirdos I don't know from school, no explanation, and i’m in the school's basement with what I hope to God is water dripping on my head.

“You said we could refuse” I said “So i’m refusing”
I don't know what kind I bath salts this guy is on. He said that ‘There are vampires and werewolves and other stuff,’ and he expects me to believe him? No thanks.
“B-but adventure,” The random gamer said. “We could defeat monsters.”

“Still no,” I said. They’ve been trying to convince me for a while. “I’m cold, my hair is wet, and i’m missing a live stream for this.”

“But you’re the only ones who can defeat them,” The man yelled.

“How? I’m a writer not a fighter” I said “Besides, we’re teenagers, couldn't you get fully grown adults to do this”

“Adults can not see them” He said.

“How old are you?”

He was silent.
“56” he admited.

“Okay so what i’m seeing is a bored old man, trying to trick a ton of teenagers into killing people”
“But vampires are real. Your principal is one”

“I knew it. She was way to pale,” Said the cheerleader.

“Can't be. I’ve seen her in the sun.” I corrected “And she’s Catholic, crosses burn vampires”

Everyone was silent.
“Okay that was a lie” He admitted.
Everyone but me gasped.

“There are vampires and werewolves but none here. I just need people to take over for me,” He said “I didn't tell any adults because they know i’m crazy.but this potion will show you the truth”
He said pulling out a bottle.
“Drink it and see”

“Sir?” The jock said, “That’s a bottle of Nyquil and it looks old.”

He looked confused.
“No it’s an ancient potion”

I looked at the label.
“An ancient potion that expired in 1986”
His eyes widened and looked a the bottle.

“Wow man you’re high as kite,” The emo kid muttered.

“Oh God....I stabbed my wife this morning with a steak and she kept screaming ‘I’m not a vampire! You’re on something!’ I thought she was trying to trick me”


I left at that point.
