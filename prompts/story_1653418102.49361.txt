STORY:
================================

I can still remember a time when things where normal. I try not to think about it too much. Reminice and pine over what once was. It will only make me miserable, I know.
But they are still there. Taunting me with dreams of my freedom and blissful ignorance before the outbreak. A time when we weren’t confined to fenced off neighborhoods. When we didnt have to worry about our children getting too curious, wandering beyond this bubble of safety the vampires have corralled us into. 
Life goes on, and there is a false sense of freedom everyone has adopted. There are still schools, supermarkets, bowling alleys, arcades. But its not real, it’s an illusion of freedom that we have come to know as normalcy.

God its bizzare saying it. Vampires. Things once of myth, and a source of fear to the skeptics and us children. Skeptics before, I guess I can’t call them that now considering the circumstances. They had been right, of course. The things had craweld out of the shadows and into the light once the rotten bastards appeared, and they realized their food sorce was in danger. Posed themselves as saviors of humanity, offered help in the form of protection against the Zombies. At a price, of course. They have their pick. You see them in the streets, now emboldened by the new power they posess over us. Not all are bad, but like everything in life they have their rotten apples.

Im well past my prime years now, they don’t spare me a glance. I’ve been alive to long in my opinion. Expired food, years have gone by since my sell by date. My children and grandchildren, I have to watch be occasionally called upon to be someones dinner. In the end, no one dies of course. But it’s the conditioned fear from years of stories of monsters that never go away. Occasional stories of the rotten ones going to far. Theres always a sense of anxiety in the back of your head, no matter the reasurances the higher ups throw at us. Will they come back safe? The answer so far has been yes.

I know I shouldn’t complain. For the most part we are safe. The zombies are no more than mere flies to the vampires. Need only be swatted away with a hand, when a human might need backup to kill just one. Resilient things, I’ll give them that much. But I can never seem to get rid of a lingering resentment for how things turned out, unjustified as it may be.

While they are just stupid brutes, the zombies have for the most part learend to stay away from these havens set up around the world. Choose instead to go for the stragglers who refuse to be protected, and live in the deadzones as we call it. Original name, I know. Occasionally we get one bolder or maybe just hungrier then the rest wandering in, but it is swiftly handled. The vampires can smell the pungent smell of rotting flesh and death infultrate their sweet circle of perfumed bloodbags from miles away. We are safe. That’s all that should matter.
Looking out the window of my small house on a street of identical buildings, seeing children being able to run around the streets laughing and playing. Unaware truely of their situation, wonderfully innocent. This gives a feeling of peace. Fleeting happiness before thoughts begin to re-emerge from the back of my head and spiral. Soon, I will be gone from this world. I know it is my time soon, and I will no longer have to needlessly worry about things I should not logically be worried about. I will leave behind my family, and life will move on. Grandchildren will grow up and have children of their own. I wont know how the world will progress, what will happen years from now. 

So I try to forget. I try to become one of those children kicking a ball in the street. To become innocent and ignorant again. Loose myself in their aimless chittering and laughter. Sink into their bright little smiles. And when it is night time, I lay awake knowing that childhood dreams turned nightmares of the day the world turns wait to torment me.
The day starts again, and all I can think is it is one day closer to the peace of an endless sleep. But for now, I will sit here and look out this little window in this little room, and I will wait.

Sorry I’m a bit tired and havent written in years but it was fun, thanks for reading if you made it this far :)
