"Halt foul demon! I know of your true name and so you must obey my every command!" 

"Wha- Why would you knowing my name make me obey you all of a sudden? What are you gonna do? Call my parents or something? I swear humans myths about demon control are the weirdest.."

"And your password"

"...ah"

"So I'm going to send your parents your browser history"

"Ok, whoa bro, not cool. Let's talk about this. You need blood rained from the sky? Milk curdled? I know some great goat ladies."

"I want a gate that opens when atoms in a gaseous state approach from one side and closes when they approach from the other."

"Oooohhh I dunno man. That's gonna violate some basic thermodynamics."
