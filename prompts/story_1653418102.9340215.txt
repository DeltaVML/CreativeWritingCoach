I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I rubbed my eyes, and although I recognized him, something was off. His smile, too perfect, like it was copied from a promotional poster. His eyes, too bright. Tan, too dark. And there was a smell…something like old water and fish and the woods.
  

  
"What's that odor?"
  

  
"It's what I'm cooking…" the 'Rock' replied. His voice was off.
  

  
"What's it going to take to finish?"
  

  
He looked at me, then away as if shamed. "About tree-fiddy."
  

  
I realized what was wrong. He was actually 8 stories tall and from the Paleolithic era!
  

  
"Baby that is not The Rock. That is that got dang Loch Ness Monster trying to get tree fiddy from you." I said to her. I shouted at it "Get out of here Loch Ness I am not giving you no tree fiddy!"
  

  
My daughter was crushed. She had wanted that pet Rock so badly…
