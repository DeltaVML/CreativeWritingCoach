I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

It makes sense in practice. The code of the spells is tied to elements and location. Most people assume that the spell is creating effects. Magic makes you fly, magic becomes fire, but that’s just not true. I am writing this all down because…
  

  
I look up from my journal, hearing footsteps approaching my door, “Oh hells.” I grab my book and leap out the window, speaking arcane gibberish which roughly translates to “Wall is Floor” reorienting my gravity to the wall of the building and running up it.
  

  
Ah, just as I assumed. The arcanists chasing me cast a fly spell to rush after me, but it makes them vulnerable to gravity manipulation as long as they aren’t oriented to the floor. I cast the same spell.
  

  
Now, can anyone guess what happens when a spell called “Dislike Floor” meets “Wall is Floor?” Well essentially it becomes “Dislike Wall” and reorients their flight controls ninety degrees so instead of flying up, they are flying away from me.
  

  
I smirk and end the spell on myself as I reach the roof. I should clarify, as of this point you don’t know why anyone is chasing me, yes? Well, allow me to explain while I finish my journal entry. I was the first one to translate the arcane language in completion using a variety of arcane linguistics, mathematics, and code. 
  

  
Because of this, I can actually work backward and create my own spells, instead of stumbling upon random ones by saying the right words accidentally. Those people chasing me, they control the arcane standard. They don’t want my knowledge to get out because it makes them powerless. And yes, many mages are power-hungry, it's a natural byproduct of the occupation.
  

  
Looks like they caught up to me again. I mumble a bunch of arcane gibberish which essentially comes out to “Sticky Floor” as they land on the roof. It’s a restraining spell, essentially. 
  

  
While they struggle to undo the spell, I cast “Object Impregnation” ah, yes, that probably sounded weird. So a lot of terms related to objects are biological. It’s essentially an object duplication spell. My journal, now complete with the explanation of how spells work, begins duplicating, or, having babies, as it were. 
  

  
My pursuers are now free and approaching me once more. I cast “Wrong Light” which creates illusionary images of me in the wrong place to buy me time as I begin casting “Different Floor” on each of the journal clones, teleporting them to well, different floor.
  

  
Eventually, my pursuers find which one is the real me. I smile and turn to face them. It’s too late, I’ve already sent out all the journals. Soon all the world will know the truth. There’s no use sticking around. But considering I’m a much better mage than any of them, I draw my wand, “Let’s have some fun.”

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
