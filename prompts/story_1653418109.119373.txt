I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Is that all, then?" She asked dryly, the clicking of her heels slowly getting louder as she approached. The sting in her voice was noticeable, yet understated, in a way that only posh British accents can be.

I glance at my phone, its cracked screen flickering, dozens of fine-lined cobwebs crawling across the UI of my Spotify playlist. It's hard to see the songs at this point, so I just hit the big "shuffle" button and hope it lands on something good.

It's Aerosmith. Not my cup of tea, but rock is rock. I've tried other genres, but they don't work as well.

For example, jazz makes turns me invisible. But it only with Kenny G songs, and you have to get completely naked for it to work. Even then, you can't really hide the headphones, so it's a mostly useless power.

Pop-music, especially early to mid 2000's pop, gives me the laser vision, but it's really difficult to control and boy, if it doesn't sap the energy right out of you. Really, it's just a one-off thing, and more of a last resort than anything else.

K-pop, weirdly enough, gives me an ultra-heightened sense of smell. It's very particular, and very unpleasant. Especially in crowded areas on hot days. Everything is just so... *amplified*.

So rock it is.

I hear the guitar chords and drums, vocals too, the lyrics unimportant, sounds of a bygone era swelling in my ears, its arrival not over-appreciated but not entirely unwelcome, either. I need it, after all.

As the music crescendos, its pitch rising and falling, the tempo crawling steadily and then whizzing forward, so too does my power level, my strength in sync with the dizzying fluctuations of speed and intensity.

A familiar power settles into my bones, and I shift my weight into my front foot, raising two balled fists on either side of my temple, ready to fight again, but not really. I shuffle in the direction of my opponent, listlessly, crossing my feet as I try desperately not to fall face forward into the pavement.

I do listen to Classical every once in a while. It makes me smarter. Whenever I put that on, it's as if the clouds in my head part, and everything seems so much simpler. But when I tried putting on some Mozart earlier, every instinct was telling me to run away and hide. I guess that is the smartest choice.

My uneven breaths make a crisp crackling sound, almost diseased sounding. Warm blood trickles from the corner of my mouth. I swipe away at it, lazily, with the back of my hand. It keeps coming back.

As my eyes slowly rise to meet hers, this woman, who looked like a corporate receptionist, in her stuffy blue-gray suit, now appeared 3 times bigger. A demon, even, her towering, dark shape indistinct in the blurry heat waves reflecting off of the concrete. I blink, and she's normal sized again.

"Damn. This is bad", I think to myself, but in my delirium I fail to notice her bend down, shifting her weight into her lead leg, the ground splintering beneath her feet. In a split second, she explodes forward, a dull, thudding "boom" sound escaping from behind her.

Before my brain can register what is happening, I am smashed into the pavement, the force of our collision sending a large plume of brown dust shooting upward and then falling back down slowly.

When the dust clears, I see that she's on top of me now. How, I'm not sure. She was just over there, and now she's here.

Her hands are around my neck. She begins to crush my windpipe, her strength like an industrial piston. I realize she's knocked my headphones out of my ears. Out of the corner of my eye I can see them, and my phone, but it's shattered into pieces.

I look up at her. She's completely expressionless. Bored, maybe.

"What *are* you?", I think, but my vision is fading now. As her face slowly goes out of focus, and the world starts to get dimmer, my mind drifts back to the day I discovered my powers.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
