STORY:
================================

“Then they fall in love!” Heather finished.
  

  
Sarah shook her head, “That can’t be the ending. Not every relationship is like you and Jess.”
  

  
Heather tilted her head, “What do you mean? They get to know each other and have a happy ever after, what’s wrong with that? And Jess and I are not together, stopping joking about that!”
  

  
Sarah sighed, “It doesn’t work like that. The woman would eventually start to feel around and find a bunch of statues of people. Also, Jess is totally into you, don’t tell me you haven’t noticed.”
  

  
“But the blind woman has no way of knowing that they aren’t just normal people. And I guess I just hadn’t noticed Jess was interested, my eyes were elsewhere.”
  

  
“Whatever, back to the story. Perhaps not at first, she wouldn’t be suspicious, but as the collection grew, she would begin to develop theories. Then when she goes to confront Medusa and she dodges the question, tensions ensue.”
  

  
“But she’d see that those petrifications weren’t Medusa’s fault. That her fear of hurting anyone is the reason why she’s a recluse.”
  

  
“Though not yet. You see, one day she wanders away from the grove. She gets a little lost but finds her way to a nearby city and hears all the bad rumors about Medusa. Then when a valiant knight asks her where she came from, the blind woman will explain that she came from the grove. The knight will think that Medusa kidnapped her and will go to confront Medusa. When the three confront each other, tensions are at a high.”
  

  
“Ooo! I like where this is going. Since the knight knows the rumors, she sees Medusa through a mirror and is enchanted by her beauty. She already thought that the blind woman was pretty and wanted to prove her heroism to her to win her over, and once she finds out Medusa and the blind woman are dating… they all become a thruple!” Heather giggled and winked at Sarah.
  

  
Sarah blinked, “Wait what? That’s not where I was going to take the story at all. The knight would be petrified by Medusa and the blind woman would be furious at her. But then, at night, she hears Medusa praying to the gods for all the people she had petrified and is working on a cure.”
  

  
“But a thruple is so much better!” Heather pouted, leaning on Sarah, then her eyes lit up, “Wait, we can combine these two ideas! Before they have a chance to become a thruple, the knight freezes, but then the blind woman helps Medusa find a cure to petrification because her dad was an alchemist.”
  

  
Heather smiled, “Hmmm… this could be interesting. But… one of the ingredients they need to cure petrification is the heart of a Hydra! For plot purposes let’s say you need all your eyes directed at Medusa for petrification to work, so the Hydra, with five heads, isn’t likely that they’ll be petrified.”
  

  
“A blind woman and a Medusa with a useless power against the Hydra, how could they ever hope to win?” Heather leaned forward, watching Sarah’s beautiful blue eyes as she told the story with an orator’s fervor.
  

  
“That’s where the statues come in. They position them all so it looks like an army flanking the Hydra on all sides, backing them to the edge of a cliff, tumbling off and defeating them!”
  

  
“Genius!” Heather beamed and scooted closer to Sarah, “Now with the heart, they can finally cure everyone!”
  

  
“Not so fast. The knight still thinks Medusa is evil, it was the blind woman who administered her the potion so Medusa wouldn’t petrify anyone again. So she goes to confront Medusa.”
  

  
Heather grinned, “So the blind woman tries to stop them from fighting, and in the process, the knight accidentally looks directly into Sarah’s eyes. She doesn’t freeze, because you see the antidote makes them immune, instead finding beauty in them.”
  

  
Sarah raised an eyebrow, “Sarah’s eyes?”
  

  
Heather blushed, “Um.. I meant Medusa, sorry.”
  

  
Sarah giggled, “That makes a lot more sense, so then what happens?”
  

  
Heather winced, “I’m not sure, I was hoping you would finish it.”
  

  
Sarah chuckled, “Oh come on, I liked where you were taking the story. Give it a try.”
  

  
Heather nodded, taking a deep breath, “Alright, so after that… the knight confesses her feelings for the blind woman, and the blind woman explains she’s already with Sarah.. I mean Medusa..”
  

  
Sarah tilted her head, “That’s the second time you confused me for Medusa. Is there something I should know?”
  

  
Heather gulped, “I should probably name the characters, it’ll be less confusing. The knight is named Jess and the blind woman is named Heather.”
  

  
“Those names are also familiar….”
  

  
Heather didn’t stop, “The knight understands, and the blind woman and Medusa um.. well, you can finish it.”
  

  
Sarah scratched her head, starting to understand, “So you don’t like Jess?”
  

  
Heather shook her head, “No, I like someone else…” She gazed into Sarah’s eyes hopefully.
  

  
Sarah blushed, “We uh.. haven’t um.. finished the story. So after t
