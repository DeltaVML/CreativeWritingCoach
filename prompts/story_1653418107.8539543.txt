I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My mark sitting in front of me was ridiculously pretty.  I felt like she might be difficult to get to commit, but she had all the signals of not only being a high paying mark, but an eager one who might become a regular.  That was fine with me, repeat customers are, well, easier.  To be honest, I wasn't sure why we were having a conversation like this.

\*\*\*

I couldn't believe how my contact was pushing the hard sell.  They was really good at working the line.  I knew to her, I was a fish on a hook, and that was fine.  No reason, because I was absolutely going to commit to their sales pitch, it would make it easier.   More on that later.

\*\*\*

We made small talk I wasn't normally the kind to 'play with my food', but something about them, I couldn't help myself.  "So, what's your *Body Count*? " I mused as I took a sip of my ginger ale.

\*\*\*

"*Body count*? That's an oddly specific question."  I wasn't sure how to answer, had I been made?

\*\*\*

"You know how many you've done..."  their eyes scouted the room as it to be looking for anyone eavesdropping. "I'll tell you mine to start with and remove some of the tension."  Again, a look to see the bartender wasn't paying active attention to the pair of us. "172 paid, a few less than that, pro-bono, or just for fun."

\*\*\*

Was this woman a serial killer on top of contract one?  "Well, wow. I'm not slut-shaming here, because what a woman does with her body is her business, well, and the IRS's, amiright?"  I leaned in, " Well I'm a little new to this side of the coin.  Nineteen...  "  I hid my face in my hands

\*\*\*

"Oh Hon, that's nothing to be ashamed of.  Why, that's admirable.  I bet you remember the look on each one of their faces." 19, wow, she's practically a virgin.

\*\*\*

"Of course, well, those I could see their faces before I took my shot."  I looked around, people had filtered in and out of the bar.  It was almost empty and the path to the door was clear.  I couldn't  let this go too much longer.  "Were all of yours up close and personal?  I mean, you'd still have to remember their faces, it's such a *personal* act.  Even if it is *business*."

\*\*\*

"Took your shot?  Are you..." I wanted to say this delicately, because I didn't want to embarrass myself or them. "packin'?" and looked directly at her lap.

\*\*\*

"Always..." I said with a smile.  I think she thought I was a trans... She is going to be very disappointed later.

\*\*\*

Oh good, she's hot and has equipment.  I bet it will be fun.

\*\*\*

I felt bad, she thought she was getting two things, and really, only getting a third that she would not be wanting.  As I looked for my opportunity, I grabbed my hidden syringe and leaned in.  She turned her legs toward me, and I used that as my opportunity.  I quickly gave her the jab at the base of her skull when I leaned in for what she thought was a stolen kiss.

\*\*\*

"Ow, what was that.  wait... what is happening." I felt  like a bee sting in the back of my head as they leaned in to kiss me.  I knew I was going to get paid that night, and probably a lot, but now I felt woozy.  

\*\*\*

"Oh dear, you've had too much to drink.  Just sit here a moment and I'll go get you some thing refreshing. "  I stood up, I watched her put her head on the bar.  The bartender was not paying attention here, and I used that opportunity to slip out.  "Number 20" I said under my breath.  This one would pay well, since a jealous wife wanted ALL distractions gone before she divorced her cheating husband.
