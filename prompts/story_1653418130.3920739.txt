STORY:

First of all, “What the fuck?” Why on earth should I tell you what’s wrong with your rule and what people really think about you? It’s not my problem that no one likes you and knows you’re killing off the people against you. Maybe if you actually listened to the speech I was giving at the bar you would know what people don’t like about you. I don’t know. What do you think Queenie? Why do none of the kiddies want to play with you on the school ground? Why can’t you get a man to stay married to you?  
She slaps me, and I spit out the dribble like they do in the movies. At least I will die sitting down - a fitting death for being punished for standing up.  
“How dare you! I lead a country where you are welcome to live at your leisure, all I ask is that my people follow me in my Baptist heritage. Baptist is basically non-denominational so there should be no struggle. I also advocate purity of mind and body. Those who are impure are given a chance to purify themselves here in this life so as to be ready to pass through to God’s feet in the next.  
I look at her and raise my eyebrows. Look who’s getting all defensive…  
Her eyes meet mine and narrow. “You’re judging me! The nerve. I come here to give you a chance to show me how I can make things right and all you do is mock me with your brazen face and dirty talk about what the gossips say behind my back. I know I’m not well-liked. God’s prophets rarely are. I just want to give you one more chance to right what you consider wrong before I flip the switch.   
“One thing?”   
One thing.  
“Stop killing people who live different lives from what the Bible dictates.   
And this is why you have to die. You are a heathen who is leading my flock astray. I will resist you and your dirty ways. Your death will serve as a cleansing for the sins of this great country. Soon we will all be united under God in the next life. I swear I will continue to do my job to make sure as many as my flock make it there.  
suit yourself.  
She flipped the switch.
