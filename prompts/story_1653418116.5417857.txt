STORY:
================================

I swear that I love you. Your face glows red like an invisible man is choking you. It was always that way. Your neck is too skinny like it’s bound with some nylon rope, and your eyes pop like a bug. It isn’t far from you looking actively disfigured, like a fast food worker would trip over their words when they looked you in the eye. You are my lobster, your skin is red and oily like it’s slicked in garlic butter. I’m so hot for you I’ll boil you. You are my rotten darling, I wanna lick the craters in your face and swallow the acne. I wanna press my rotten teeth against yours until they crack. I wanna suck the piss out of you and then lick it back over you. I love you.
