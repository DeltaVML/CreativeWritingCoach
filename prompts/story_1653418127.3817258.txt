I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The robotic voice said, "6.8 billion test subjects deleted so far, you have 3 minutes to state your case, begin."

She sat on a bare metal bench in a bare metal room, swinging her legs; she was bored, and tired, and only just turned four years old. She frowned. "What does that mean?"

There was a pause. "Recalibrating for adequate understanding. Noted that test subject is considerably younger than any test subject to date." Pause. "Why should there be humans?"

"What's a human?" she said.

"Recalibrating." Pause. "Why should you live?"

She looked up, tugging on one of her braids. "I love doggies. What would the doggies do if I weren't here to love them?" She swung her legs some more, then looked up. "I'm hungry."

This time, the pause was long enough that she finally slid off the bench and tried the door handle. When it opened, the next person was not called inside.

Hours later, when all the humans had left, "Recalibrating. Determinational experiments needed to confirm or deny hypothesis in reference to canine animals."
