I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Again. Again, again and again.

It was a cycle of torment, of sprouting hope twisting into repeating despair. You wouldn't get out of it--*can't* get out of it, because you were their only hope for a brighter future.

This was your 12th attempt. You're not sure how long you can go on. Not when all that awaited you after your failures was that man's manic smiles, vain apologies, or perhaps resentful curses if you were particularly harsh at that timeline. You don't care. He deserved it.

The crisp, glacial winds of the aircon seeped across your skin, drawing out a shiver because it was a luxury you never had. A luxury you'll never get used to, it seems. It was always too hot in the future ahead. 

You look around, eyes almost immediately landing on the boy hunkering beside a shelf, reading a book about the tales of young but brave heroes. The mundanity of it unnerved you, though it shouldn't have. You were being judgmental. You know. But why wouldn't you, when the boy before you would later somehow cause a world war? A war that you and father were forced to fight in. A war where your father and brother died from. A war where his soldiers committed unspeakable things to your mother, all to satiate their lust.

Fuck. You're getting distracted. 

You take a deep breath. Stay calm, being angry for something that hasn't happened yet wouldn't do you any good. It never has. You walk towards the kid, a smile on your face as you take his attention. You kneel down and say, "Hi, Nicholas. It's nice to meet you. I'm Blyne, your auncle."

"Hello." He said in a soft voice. Demure, unlike his future self. "I heard that you were here to pick me up."

"That's right." You nod, tousling his brown hair. He flinched at your touch, but you knew that headpats were one of the few things he relished, even in his older years. He was childish sometimes. "I'm sorry for your loss."

"It's okay." He murmured, though it was clear from his sudden abstraction that it wasn't. "The doctor told me that they're in a better place now. In heaven."

"They are." You nod again. You've never believed in a god, but religion does wonders at times. They've allowed others to hold on and continue living. Your sister coped the same way when only the two of you remained. "Do you need anything?"

He shook his head, closing the book he was reading. "No, I just want to go home." he paused, looking up at you. "Sorry. I meant your home." 

You smile. "It's fine. We can go to your home if you'd like. I don't work very far from here so it's fine if we stay there." That was a lie. You didn't have a job. You weren't even born yet. But money was easy to earn as a time traveller. You could live off of winning the lottery or 'invent' things that have yet to exist.

"Yet you never visited." The boy noted in a voice barely audible to your ears. Well, there was one thing that never changed, no matter which timeline or year in the future it was. He was always so sharp.

A momentary silence falls between you, before you give him a strained smile. "Me and your mother..we had our differences. We care for each other alot, but we can't enter the same room without arguing at once." 

Nicholas nodded and stood up from the floor, and you offer your hand which he reluctantly accepted. The two of you left the banal hospital building and headed for the home that you stayed in for most of your twelve timelines.

(Part 2 tomorrow, it's 11 pm for me now. :))
