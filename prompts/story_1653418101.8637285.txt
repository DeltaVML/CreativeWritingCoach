STORY:
================================

For the past 50 years they've been building an army unseen to the world. In bakery's across the globe, bakers had been secretly plotting society's downfall. Pushing themselves to make more and more realistic cakes, none of us simple minded folk could have seen what would come next. At some point during 2027-no one knows for sure-bakers began replacing items across the country. According to the now barely standing government, over the next 3 years these mass roll outs became increasingly common. During this time it wasn't uncommon to see news story's about hyper realistic cake being found where it shouldn't , lampposts, sidewalks, and even entire buildings were revealed to be made of cake. No one realized *people* would be in the next headlines. The day the story came out, the day it was revealed our president was made of cake, was the day all hell broke loose. The worlds finest scientists were unable to deduce much, it was found that the cake was somehow alive. It came to be understood that the cake consumed its victim before taking the victims form, this was how the mass roll outs happened. Baker's posed as anything from engineers to doctors and planted the cake anywhere they could along the way. The world became hell, sons and daughters killed their parents in fear they too would be infected. Riots filled the streets as the people found out truly how much was made of cake. The baker's took advantage of the chaos to introduce their own hyper realistic cake military, our own government crumpled under their force. Guns, trucks, and even battle ships were found to be cakeified. Top generals came out in support of our new cake rulers. Arguing that they couldn't possibly fight against a force who could so simply infiltrate their ranks. The few remaining survivors of humanity were forced to hide underground or conform to the cake society. After the first cake related headlines were shown to the public my wife and I decided to go deep underground. For some 8 years now we've been safe from the cake, and for that I'm grateful. Even know as I write this she sits next to me enjoying a nice slice of.... wait... is that... *Cake?!* 

"What the hell are you doing!" I screamed at her. Slowly she turned to face me, her face looked like melting wax as she slowly disintegrated into herself. I watched as the love of my life became cake, the human shaped being now turned toward me and outstretched its hand, in a voice that sounded like broken glass it whispered, "You can't escape our rule you fool!"
