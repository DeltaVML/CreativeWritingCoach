I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The mountain of sedatives I'd just taken were quite effective at quieting the screams of the people around me as they were consumed by fire. I'd finally done it. I watched the world turn to embers and closed my eyes. I woke up the next day in the same bed I had the last 137,433 times and ran downstairs to slit my throat when the silence gave me pause. Every morning, the TV has been blaring Maury Povich (Shaquetia is back with her *50TH* man and this one HAS to be the father!(spoilers: he's not)) and yet the TV stood on it's milk crates silently in front of me. As I walked outside, Katie rode her bike by me. Oblivious to me. I know her entire life story one small conversation at a time but she has no idea who I am. As I walked to the gas station for breakfast, I considered what to have today. I'd eaten everything in the store at least once (even the pickled eggs) and today the pastry sounded more appealing than not. I walk up to Gary intending on telling him that I would settle my tab on payday but he refused to turn around. Not sure why the cigarettes and condoms behind the counter were so captivating but whatever. I walked out of the store. Maybe tomorrow he'd be less busy. Still strange that I hadn't had to use that tired lie today like I had the last ten thousand times but I forced myself to ignore it. Walking around the town I kept noticing little things different. Toys in the yards out of place. Dogs not there to bark like they always had. As I strolled into the bar for my afternoon memory cleanse, I saw someone for the first time. He was taller than me and wearing all black with red threading. "come here often?" He asked as I closed the door. I should have stayed home and watched Maury.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
