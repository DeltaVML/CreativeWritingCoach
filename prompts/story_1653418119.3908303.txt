I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

With your husband by your side, you both enter the room of the monarch. Months of planning, even longer preparation, and a precise, swift execution. The neighboring kingdom had no chance. 

You proudly hold your chin up high as you gloat, "It's only a matter of time until this city is on its knees, the water treatment facility has been sabotaged to release a poison into the system. Soon enough, your people will succumb to a terrible illness."

Your husband, also proud of his accomplishment alongside you, joins in, "Your rule is finished!"

The Monarch trades glances between the two of you before reaching for a clipboard with his good arm, "Actually, because you were able to poison our water supply, you forced us to take a look at our city's pipe infrastructure and we realized it was severely outdated, so thank you for bringing that to our attention, millions of people would have gotten sick over these next few years. 

Next, because you snuck passed our security so easily, we found that funds specifically for that were being embezzled by local politicians, so you've helped bust a major fraud ring.

Lastly, the pathogen you unleashed, while it does give people mild diarrhea, it is an excellent source of vitamin C."

Having heard enough of what your actions have done, you draw your pulse pistol and shoot the monarch. He is thrown from his chair with a cracking sound. One of his limbs surely broke from that impact. Somehow, the monarch stands, moving his arm.

"You fixed my shoulder!" :D
