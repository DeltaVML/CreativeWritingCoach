Julian’s Holy Healing Gel- How to Use. 

1. Open singular package near wound or hole in body. Make sure no other living beings are in the vicinity. 

2. The mist from the gel will settle around the open wound. Do not attempt to swat away the mist, as it is reverting the wound to a healthy form. 

3. Lie down, preferably somewhere safe. You will feel some minor dizziness and fainting. Do not fight this. 

4. You will see a specter of a ghost from your long forgotten past attempt to inhabit your body. If you let them, you will permanently become a specter yourself, your soul rended from its own body forever. In order to resist, you must shout at as high a pitch as you can. This is Banshee for “You’re not my dad.” The specter will understand, and leave. Do not move anything other than your mouth during this section. 

5. After this occurs, your body will start to feel tired. Close your eyes, and sleep will overtake you. Not sleeping during this portion will lead to multiple specters returning to destroy your immortal soul. 

6. During your sleep you will experience weird dreams. These are normal, however, if your dreams include anyone using the word “cheese” or “Cheese Timeline” please report them to the authorities at once at the end of this ritual. 

7. At this point, you will see the face of god. If you have not already, prepare to wipe your memory of this encounter. If you can, avoid interacting with them. Do not answer any questions they ask you. Doing so will give them control over your body when you awaken. 

8. Slowly, but surely, you will wake up. If you still remember meeting the face of God, please immediately seek out psychic attention. 

9. Apply gel to healed portion of your body. The gel itself will harden, acting as a brace. 

10. Speak to your nearest wizard, sorcerer, warlock, bard, cleric, or Druid about any un-stated side effects of Julian’s Holy Healing Gel. 

(Other Side Effects may include body swapping, delusions of grandeur, trauma from falsely imagined deaths of loved ones, or slight nose bleeding. Please talk to your doctor if any of these happen to you.)
