I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Immortal - I've been thinking about it the last few months. That must be it, I'm immortal. It's a curse. Why? Because it does not come with invulnerability nor fast healing. Maybe not with healing at all, but how could I tell? I've been here since the day when someone should have known, but nobody did. I'm wondering how many more …

So what happened? Just a happy little accident at work, touching a wire that should be dead, that somehow was missed when we double-checked them … usually I'd have just pulled away my hand, but somehow this time my fingers just would not let go until my heart had stopped. The other guys were at a different part of the building, making noise. Still my body held tension for just long enough to make sure that it stopped working. Then I sank down and lay there for what seemed to be hours, fully aware and seeing through my eyes. I wasn't breathing and soon my muscles did stop obeying my commands at all. What else should it do without energy? It should do that!

Finally they found me and called an ambulance, but even though I could see them do their job, they found me dead. They drove me off in a bag after closing my eyes and shutting my mouth (thanks for that), put me in a freezer and left me there for some time. I felt my body hurt from the temperature, then slowly it started going numb.

When they held my funeral I could barely feel being moved, but i heard them. Some light fell through my closed eyelids, and when they opened, I could only see as if through fog. Should my eyes be decomposing? My brain should be, my ears should be!

They unzipped the bag, cut away my work clothes from the limbs that must have been attached below my head, then put new clothes there. Some makeup for my probably pale face and a short drive to the funeral. Some people cried, my family most certainly among them. I could only lay there and hear, thinking about crying out, thinking about crying with tears, too.

Now I'm still somehow alive, hearing and thinking. I think my mouth fell open. I sometimes hear things move nearby, probably rats gnawing at my body. The body that betrayed me by dying before me. Oh please gnaw away that brain that does not die, or maybe at least gnaw away my ears.
