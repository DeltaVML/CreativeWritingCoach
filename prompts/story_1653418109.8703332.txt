STORY:

A little late and a little different but I wanted to contribute this

I knew Anthony was a mind reader. Long before he told me. The way he stared at me and my over active imagination. The way he moved when ever a big plot twist came along. The look he gave when my character turned out to be evil. He told me soon enough before the summer or 6 grade begging me to not continue the story until I come back from summer vacation. That was the start of our friend ship. The start of the only time I ever had a friend. But things are changing now and things get harder as we grow older. 

This weekend my world when’t to shit. My Grandma, the person that more that anyone I was close to died. And in the middle of my parents devours I was not in a good head space. But my mom refused to let me stay home from school. So Monday morning I packed my undone homework. And went off to school. 

I shared my first period with Antony. It was math. As we walked into class I saw the look he gave me. The look that told me that he was looking forward to the next chapter of the pirate story I was spinning for him, and myself. I sat down and the teacher started to drown on and on about fractions of something, I wasn’t listening. I tried to start my story. 

“And the pirate queen rose from her throne. And stared down at Henry and said… and said”

I couldn’t think of the next thing to say. Tears started to come to my eyes and I just wanted to run. Without thinking I stood up and ran out of the class room. I knew I would get detention but I didn’t care. Nether would my parents. I wanted to run far far away to one of my stores. To just not have to deal with the shitty hand life dealt me. But I settled for a tree in the play yard. I slumped down and held my eyes in my nees begging for some magic Fairy God mother to fix my problems but nothing changed I wasn’t transportation to my stories. I was startled when there was a tap on my shoulder and looked up. There was Anthony sitting next to me. 

“Your  Grandma died this weekend” he said  “your not handling well I see.” 
“Yah” I responded through broken sobs “I loved her” 
“Do you want to talk about it” 
“No”
So we sat there side by side until the security came and got us and forced us back in to the class. At lunch Anthony pulled out a book from his backpack and handed it to me. There was my name on the cover.
“I made a book of your best stories and thought you would like a copy”
