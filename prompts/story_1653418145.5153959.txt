STORY:
================================

The final step up into the palace throne room was more a half-step, really. An intentional design choice, intended to subtly remind those entering that the King of Grengard was not so high-and-mighty as to be beyond his citizenry. I, however, required a different message.

With a flourish beneath my cloak I sealed my connection with Quonol, the realm of deception, unveiling the depth of my power. My first step toward the throne fell with the weight of a god; the royal guard recoiled as if struck. The throne room itself was 40 paces in length. 40 paces which shifted eagerly beneath my own languid steps, carrying me across in only five.

The silence seemed to stretch as the king's eyes narrowed on my own. With each passing moment, the guards seemed to shrink a little more before the vastness, the inevitability, that they now faced. There was no need to rush. A god does not beseech the mortals in his path.

At last the king's lips parted, "Welcome to Grengard, friend." His voice, though faint - as if traveling a great distance - echoed amicably around the chamber. "To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?"

There are only three types of people that can stand before such power without shaking: worshipers, the iron-willed, and the suicidal. Royalty tended toward the second.

"Your highness," my voice rolled like thunder through the palace foundations, "I bring you an accord. Your western waters are plundered by The Hive, and your northern trade is strangled by Elven blockades. Grengard is in a war of attrition against foes that you are woefully unequiped to strike, yet-" 

"If you wish to join a warlock brigade, stanger, you should speak with Admirial Rhizan. This pompous show only marks you as an upstart," the king interrupted.

"Yet," I continued, teeth now clinched, "I am willing to deal with one of your foes personally, in exchange for a parcel of land within your kingdom. An abandoned temple, to be specific, on the southeast coast."

The king opened his mouth to speak again, but I raised a hand and his voice was caught in the stillness. His eyes widened, as the roar of wind filled his ears alone. "I could simply claim it as my own," my voice cut directly into his mind. "I was under the impression, however, that I could enter this land as an ally instead of as a conqueror. Now, though? Now I am considering the role of usurper. You have not afforded me the respect I deserve, your highness."

His lips moved in silence, and his guard cowed uselessly - torn between duty and self-preservation.

"Right now you are falling. Sitting on your throne, yet plummeting to your demise. Choose my role with your next words."

The king smiled at this. An aged hand raised and he tapped his crown slowly. I allowed him to speak through the magic surrounding him, "Do you know what this is?" He asked, and continued without waiting for my reply, "'Hubris.' So named by Correllon, goddess of Chaos and Knowledge." His smile widened further, "I can see your power, stranger. It is as depthless as the sky, and twice as empty."

A cold fear nestled into my gut.

"You command power that is not your own! That of The Thus and Is and Evermore, I believe!" He was cackling on his throne now, "You bear a promise of power, but you haven't power of your own to deliver it!"

The ruse was done, foiled from the start. I turned to run, the yawning space of the throne room was now my only advantage and again the distance shrank quickly beneath me. My feet hit sand where the half-step should have been and in an instant I was pulled neck deep. The wait was agony as I listened to the click of the king's shoes cross the throne room behind me.

"A little spider warned me of your visit, you know? I made a deal with The Beckoner Below Us in preparation." I looked up at the old king, as he tapped his crown again, "I understand he enjoys toying with your lot. I'm sure there's a small cage for you..." he paused to kick some sand in my direction, "somewhere down there."

He began to cackle once again as a grip manifested on my ankles, pulling me slowly into the dark.

*(So, I've been working on worldbuilding for a set of projects I'd like to undertake for a while now. I wanted to fit the prompt into the world an magic system that I built, so this is the first little story I've actually constructed for that world. Also, my main account, "King_Sarathos" is shadowbanned for commenting on things too much - which support has told me probably triggered their spam filter... So, sorry for the low karma and stuff.)*
