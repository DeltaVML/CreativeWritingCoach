I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose.

STORY:
================================

He fell. From inmeansurable heights he fell during what must have been a few treacherous seconds, yet to him felt like nothing less than an eternity of mindless thrill and torment. When the crushing hit of the fall happened, there was no solid land, only the unforgiving, ever itching bites of sand. He cried. What was a grievous scratch of pain were, to his perception, the agonizing throes of once healthy bones now shattered into brittle bits, puncturing his flesh and nerve endings to depths unprecedented. 

As he screamed in nameless suffering, he looked up to the skies, in hopes of seeing the colossal shadow of his protectors loom over his hurtful soul to comfort him, yet all he saw were the cold, dead handles of the slide's plastic steps. There was no hope for healing and a future, at least while his nerves roared damnedly hoping for the torment to stop.

As it turns out, little Jake from year 3 kindergarden mis-stepped on the playground slide, and had barely scraped his arm on break-time.
