I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I peeled off my bloody tattered shirt and looked down at my chest. I was pretty messed up. The werewolves had done a number on me. I already hated New London Connecticut and my friend just had to be the asshole who sang a few lines of *that* Warren Zevon song. We had been out drinking. Apparently my power thought it was a close enough fit. Not much I could do about it now as I slumped against the wall. My efforts to staunch the bleeding were to no avail as they stalked closer. This was a nightmare come true. It became hard for me to keep my eyes open. I was so tired but i wasn't going to go out without one last song.

    Non, rien de rien
    Non, je ne regrette rien
    Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait
    Ni le mal
    Tout ça m'est bien égal
    ...

I opened my eyes with them just a yard away now. I could smell their fetid breath. I knew if I closed my eyes now I would be dead. Without blinking, I opened my eyes and rolled out of bed. Best started my day again I guess. Maybe GTFO out of Connecticut just to be safe.

But before I could make it across the room the clock radio alarm went off. I froze. First werewolves, now this. Maybe it wouldn't trigger. Maybe I was safe. "They say we're young and we don't know we won't find out until we grow." I ran. I ran so far away. I sat up. Yep, just as I feared. I was 10 years old again in a nice BnB in Punxsutawney.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
