STORY:

A panel of older men sat behind a table and stared at me. Their occupations varied across the pediatrics healthcare field including a few child psychologists.

The man who sat in the center of the table looked at my resume. He furrowed his brow.

"It seems as if you're not qualified for our program," he said.

"Shucks," the boy no older than 9 years old said. He shuffled his feet. "I've always wanted to learn magic."

The man leaned forward. "But you know how magic is generated, yes? Magic taps into one’s misery. The more depression or anger, the more supernatural potential. Our students have gone through many hardships. I've wept over some of their stories."

He set the resume face down on the table. "But you are a cheerful boy. You have as much sunshine as cloudless day at a beach."

The boy frowned but the man kept talking. "Becoming a magician can be a curse. The weight our students carry is heavy. Most would give up their ability to fly or cast spells to have a simple life like yours."

"But a simple life is boring. Magicians get to go on all the adventures and learn things normal people can't. They live a life like video game while I can only play them," the boy said as a tear streaked down his cheek. He felt as if he was sentenced to a monotonous existence.

The man scrabbled his chin. He sought to tell the child to wait several years and ultimately the life would provide some currency to perform magic at its most basic form: Some of the boy's closest friends will drift as they age; a beloved pet will pass; he’ll place his entire confidence in a woman who will eventually bust his crown...

If the boy is lucky, he'll watch his parents grow old until they cannot.

But the old man knew that telling any young child about the future would fall on deaf ears. Children are only familiar with the now.

"Tell you what," the old man said. "I see you're eager to learn and be around magic. You don't meet the requirements to conjure a spell but based off your resume, I think we can find a place for you here. On the weekends; perhaps after school hours on certain days."

"Yes?" the boy said as he looked up. He showed a hint of a smile.

"Students in this program don't have a lot of friends. It's one of the reasons why they have an abundance of misery. You mentioned how you played video games a moment ago. Could you bring a couple and play with the students? You can show them there is more to life than pain and suffering."

The old man flipped over the boy's resume and read through it again.

"And you have a dog! Is it friendly? Oh, I'm certain our students would love to play with a cute pooch!"

“But won’t happiness limit your students’ magical ability?" the boy whimpered.

"Yes, but valor isn’t everything this program aims for. If you continue to be your merry self, you will offer the others something the strongest magic cannot provide."
