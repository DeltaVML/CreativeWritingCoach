I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose.

STORY:
================================

"Whoa," Ethan said, peering down at the weird creature. It looked *mostly* like a cat, except for its floppy, beagle-like ears. "Look at this little dude..."

"Did that thing just *talk?"* Dane asked, pointing at it, suspiciously. 

"There's no time, *nyan!"* the creature cried, in a high squeaky voice. It stood up on it's hind legs, and its front paws seemed to just sort of *become* tiny furry fists, somehow. It shook them for emphasis as it spoke. "The armies of Space Baron Gigadark are on their way to your world, *wan-wan!"*

"I told you! I told you assholes we shouldn't have tried Aiden's dad's edibles! Now our brains are *f---ed!*" Tyler groaned, placing his head in his hands.

Aiden snorted. "Dude, shut the f--- up, that thing *did not* come from a *quarter* of a special brownie. It's gotta be like...animatronic or something. Like one of those little drone animals with cameras inside, that biologists use to spy on turtles and meerkats and shit."

"Here I go, *nyan*!" the creature cried. It leaped *10 feet* straight into the air, executing a series of impossible midair backflips.

"WHAT THE *F---?!"* all four boys exclaimed, in unison.

"NEKO-INU-CHAN HENSHIN POWERRR!" the creature -- Neko-Inu-Chan, apparently -- shouted, and burst alight with energy that washed over all four of the young men. They closed their eyes, and threw up their arms to shield their faces. 

When they regained their vision, each of them pointed at the others.

"WHAT THE *F---?!"* all four boys exclaimed, for the second time in 15 seconds.

The weird cat-dog-thing had landed and stopped glowing. Each of them was now wearing an asian-style buttoned black jacket, identical except for the edges of the high collars, which were a different color for each. These, the boys thought, were actually kind of badass, in a cosplayish sort of way.

Unfortunately for them, any potential badassery that might have been inherent in their new look was utterly *obliterated* by the matching black *shorts,* which stopped a couple inches above their knees.  The shiny black shoes they now wore, complete with black socks, did nothing to improve matters.

"What did you *do* to us, you stupid little f---?!" Aiden demanded.

"I turned you into powerful magic heroines, *wan-wan!*" Neko-Inu-Chan responded, sounding confused.

"Wait, *heroines?* We're *dudes!*" Dane shouted, exasperated. He sighed with relief when a quick cupping revealed that his junk was still present and intact.

Neko-Inu-Chan blinked in surprise. It pulled out a pair of glasses from *somewhere,* fogged the lenses with its breath, and then wiped them on its fluffy fur before putting them on, greatly magnifying it's already large eyes.

"Oh *shit,"* Neko-Inu said, in a normal adult voice. "You're dudes!"

"Yeah!" Ethan snapped. He gestured down at himself. "What the hell is this shit you put on us?"

"Those are your magic b-battle uniforms!" Neko-Inu stammered, as it looked between them frantically, panic creeping into its voice.

"You think I'm going to *fight somebody* in this?" Tyler exclaimed, incredulously. "I literally want to kick *my own* ass, right now!" 

"Short-shorts? You realize we're only *sixteen,* right? F---ing pervert." Dane added. 

"Seriously!" Aiden agreed, angrily. "What are you, some kind of...magical...*groomer cat?"* 

"SHUT THE F--- UP!" Neko-Inu-Chan shouted, startling the boys into silence. "Just...just give me a second here...ohshitohshitohshit..." He looked at Tyler. "P-please tell me this is at least *Japan?"*

"This is America, and I'm *Korean,* you *dick!"* Tyler snarled. "F---ing *racist* chomo Pokemon..."

"I'm not a racist!" Neko-Inu-Chan wailed, its voice becoming squeaky and childlike. "And I'm not a *chomo,* I swear! I...I just got really wasted last night and went to the wrong country and bestowed my magic on a wrong-gendered group of high school students...and...and...."

Neko-Inu-Chan collapsed onto the ground, putting its face into its paws and crying inconsolably.

Aiden frowned, turning to Tyler. "Oh, *nice,* dude."

"Yeah that was kinda harsh." Ethan added, disapprovingly.

Dane nodded in agreement.

"How am I the asshole?" Tyler demanded. "Look at these f---ing shorts we're wearing! We look like we go to school on *Epstein's island!"*

"Yeah, but, I mean..*.look* at him. He's doing his best, right? And he's like *two feet tall.*" Dane said, frowning. "I kinda feel shitty about yelling at him, now..."

"Hey..." Ethan said, gently, crouching down beside the sobbing cat-thing. "It's alright, buddy. It's not your fault."

"How is it *not--"* Tyler began, but Aiden shushed him.

Neko-Inu-Chan sniffed, and looked up, hopefully. "T-then you'll fight the evil forces of Space Baron Gigadark, and save your planet with the power of positivity and friendship? Nyan?"

The four looked at each other.

"Alright, *fine."* Ethan grumbled. The others nodded, reluctantly.

"Whew!" Neko-Inu-Chan said, its voice returning to normal. "Thanks, you're really pulling my a
