STORY:
================================

Yeah it was Saturday at three am but we were all here dressed in dark coloured hoodies and black sweats and leggings. The reason why? Because Mrs Delaney had called us. We’d each received an email at midnight saying todays class was going to be held at three am in the new amusement park. This had bought no shock. Every week she would schedule something like this, always finding an odd time and place to meet and we’d revise over the history topics we’d learn in class. She had some great detail about most the events and I know everyone thought about where she got the knowledge from as it often sounded like she was talking about her own experiences. There was a minor rumour going around school that she was a vampire and whilst your class understood it they’d all mutually agreed to never tell anyone what went on in history class.
