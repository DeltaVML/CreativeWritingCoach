STORY:

Something prodded on the senses of It That Slumbers. Distantly, faintly, a call sounded from the depths of creation. Beasts howl in the night, and one of them is known to the unwakeable horror. Bes'ghaull spoke the names and drew in dirt the ancient signs.

Reluctantly, It That Slumbers woke, and teetered anxiously on the precipice between dream and sensibility. It sensed chill and damp and windy in short, breathy whisps. It knew the call.

It rose, with Bes'ghaull racing in front of it. Her chitinous claws clattered against the smooth floor. It stumbled and plodded up to the gateway. It slammed an appendage, ripped with tendon and bone, against the lock, and heaved the gateway open.

She ran past it, into the night. Then she stopped. She turned to look back. Gazing up into it's glossy eyes in the moonlight, she squats and poops.

"Good girl, Daisy," it says with considerable awkwardness. So acknowledged, she runs back into the gateway, to the chamber where It That Slumbers dwells until the great fire in the sky again rouses it. She lays down where It That Slumbers had slept, and stretches out horizontally across it.
