I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Jesus christ you are hard to chase down. Im low on gas, low on food and still havent made my rescue quota. Get in!" She said with english laced with some eastern european accent.

"You think you are really going to kill me" Jack said pointing his pistol at her

"Kill you? Why would I kill you? Get in the before they come back you dumbass. I have air con...and beer." The female vampire said 

"Isn't that what Vampires do?" He asked as he got. Yeah was probably dead soon anyway either way.  He grabbed the "beer" and opened the bottle and drank....BEER?!?

"This really isnt bad" He said

"If I wanted to kill you why bring the beer with me. You can shear a sheep many times but you can only skin them once. You work with us and as you Americans used to say "You get 3 hots and a cot""

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
