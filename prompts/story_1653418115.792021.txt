I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

So, once upon a time, I say

There lived a man with noted fame

An engineer with talents bright

Designing aircraft, super-flight!

*

Now, Edward Murphy was his name

And through his work he earned acclaim

But aerospace was not his crown

Nor military service rounds

*

It turns out Murphy's greatest feat

Was speaking such a line complete

*If anything can go a'wrong...*

Then **"Murphy's Law"** – *It WILL go wrong!*

*

What does it mean, this Murphy's Law?

Well, simply put – it means "You fall"

You're late and driving off for work?

*Guess what: the car's transmission spurts*

*

A sunny day for picnic fun?

*Now, sudden storm – the day is done*

You're craving coffee at the store?

*Oh dear, no wallet – drinks no more*



*

Your wedding dress is beautiful?

*It's torn and now unusable*

Five hours typing essay work?

*A power surge – PC is nurked*


*

There's much more we could so discuss

But now, I think we've had enough

You understand the gist of this

It's clear – no more such reminisce 

*

So now we've talked of Murphy's Law

(It's pleasant as a Devil's Claw)

Is there a way to counteract

Such supernatural curse abstract?

*

Could we, in any shape or form

Fight back this pessimistic swarm?

Are we condemned to suffer through

This imminent, impending doom?

*

Now, hear me out – let me explain

Just give me time, I will not feign

There may just be a wise id'ea

No need to pray for Hail Mar'ias

*

It's simple, see, it's not all bad

Solution for this Murphy lad

A person need not stand and fight

Get hurt from *paranormal blight*

*

The answer's staring at our eyes

Just grab some snacks, some cake, and pies

Go snuggle under blankets warm

And read some Reddit more and more

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
