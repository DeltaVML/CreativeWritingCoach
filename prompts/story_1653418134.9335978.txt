STORY:
================================

The blind woman woke up in a cold sweat and jumped out of bed.

Medusa jumped up too. "What? What is it my love?"

The blind woman, shaking and in tears, pointed at the bed. "I-I-I h-heard a-a-"

Medusa came closer. "Heard what, my dear?"

"A-a-a...snake!"

Medusa reared back in surprise, a stone of dread settling at the bottom of her stomach. "A snake?"

The blind woman nodded. "Lots of them! By my head!"

"Oh..." said Medusa. "So you're scared of snakes..."

"Yes," said the blind woman. "I can't stand them! They're the reason why I'm blind. When I was a little girl, I was playing in the forest and I grabbed a stick that turned out to be a snake and it shut venom into my face and bit me in the eyes." She was shaking with anger now. "If I wasn't blind, I would kill every snake that I could see."

"Oh..." Medusa said softly, looking away sad and patting her head of snakes to calm them down and keep them quiet.
