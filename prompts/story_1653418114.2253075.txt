STORY:

A hot summer night.

The air is heavy with the scent of an oncoming storm, the moon is locked behind dark, thick clouds, and the lone woman walks the street of a remote village. 

She appears under the light of the lampposts and disappears into the darkness in between them, heading for a dirt path. She wears a jean and a red hoodie.

Dirt crunches under her boots, the last house disappears behind her. During the day this is just a meadow bordering a fenced field meant for the cows to lazy around and grow fat. In the night, the mind plays tricks with the shadows, shapes take form for a second before vanishing, reality and fantasy merge together. 

Trees border the path, the leaves rustle gently under the wind as she walks upwards. Atop the hill, a much-needed fresh breeze plays through her hair and invigorates a horde of insects hidden in the grass. Suddenly, the relative emptiness is filled with the chatter of critters, and a lull in the clouds shows a single star.

She sits there, atop the hill, back against a lonely oak tree, gazing at the village lights below. Beyond the village, nothing but the calm dark. 

Claire has been walking this path since childhood to soothe her mind, it worked just as well in adulthood. She never got over the sudden dread she could feel when her imagination made the shadows come to life, brought her head to turn and wonder if, just for once, there wasn't indeed something right there in front of her. A childish fear she was delighted to have kept into adulthood.

Seclusion, darkness, peace, a sanctuary.

"Risky night to be alone for a girl, is it not?"

Claire jolts upright. 

Not every shape at night is a trick from the mind.

She hadn't heard the man coming, doesn't recognize the voice. She can only make out his shape, a tall, slender person with large hands and a curiously high-pitched voice.

"Who are you?"

"Someone who walks in the night, just like you."

He isn't from the village, and few would dare walk these parts without a light, he has none. He takes a step forward, Claire takes a step back.

"Don't approach me."

"Isn't it why you're here?" she can hear his wicked smile as he speaks, "to meet the big bad wolf, to play the fierce girl when you're dying for the beast to come out for you?"

A light drizzle comes down, Claire hears the envy, the aggression, the wolfish savagery in the words. Whatever the man is, he's dangerous, and she should have been more careful. 

"Fuck off."

"Won't happen."

His joy pierces through in his words, he's delighted to have found a lone girl lost at night, far from everything, for his own amusement, for whatever horrors this meant for Claire.

It started to pour. Claire pulled up her red hood, she wouldn't go down without a fight. 

"Fierce," she hears him licking his lips as he speaks, "I like that."

Just as he's about to advance, the clouds open and the full moon shines through, a ghostly light illuminating the gaunt, grinning man and a soaked Claire with her fists closed. The instant stretches wide, droplets fall from the leaves of the oak tree over Claire.

"Last warning," she whispers, just loud enough to be heard over the rain.

"Amuse me, get wild,"

Claire can see the stiffness in his pants.

"You asked for it. Fifi, come and say hi."

*Thump*, it is barely audible, the sound of a heavy being taking great care to not make too much noise. 

Claire didn't like her night outings to be cadenced by Fifi's loud steps, it scared the owls and muted the insects. The latter still happened, they could feel when Fifi was near and weren't sure if they could sing.

All the fun is drained from the man's face as he slowly turns around.

Fifi stands taller than the madman, despite walking on his fours. A stocky, bulky mockery of a wolf, with every single muscle bulging wide across his frame, steely limbs to spring over wide distances, teeth glistening in the dark, eyes sparkling with sheer savagery. 

"Go and get him, boy."

Not every shadow at night is a trick of the mind.

Fifi certainly isn't, and his teeth sinking into the tender flesh of a fragile neck are ample proof of it, the realest experience tonight for the poor man, and his last too.

It's over in an instant, the neck cracks like a twig under the titanic maw, and Fifi is having a midnight snack while Claire pats his head.

"It's getting dangerous to walk out there at night."

Fifi grunts.

Anyway, back to the scheduled program of the night.

Claire sits back at her tree, looking at the night over the land, while Fifi chomps his appetite away behind her. The rain is a needed refreshment after the hot day.

In a minute, Fifi has ended his meal and comes to lay next to Claire.

A minute later, and the insects starts to sing again.

Tonight is a good night.
