STORY:
================================

Ofttimes I'd find myself wondering how many years it had been since I first met him. I was out with some friends for a night at Steeples, the only gay bar you'd be able to find in our tiny little shit town back in the seventies. I'd had more than a few, and had sparked a conversation with a stranger - he was tall, with a gorgeous body and a shyness that could be construed as off-putting. He had asked if I'd wanted to go home with him, insisting that he had better booze at home. My gut told me no - there was something in his eyes; some vacant deadness that made me feel as though I was sinking through an infinite abyss towards oblivion when I looked in to them. My friends pushed and pushed me to do it, and I finally agreed. I hope they're doing well these days. I don't hold anything against them.

It wasn't until we got into his house that he introduced himself to me as Jeff. In practically the same breath, he handed me a glass of amber liquid, and I was too stupid to ask questions. He had dissolved enough Valium in the whiskey to knock out God. It wasn't until nearly morning where I woke up in his bed, swaddled in blankets and gently lain to sleep. I had an absolutely crushing headache, and I tried to wiggle free of the blankets to no avail.

"Jeff?" I called out into the night.

He grunted, turned over in the bed, and screamed. He leaped out of bed and grabbed a nearby liquor bottle and repeatedly bashed it against my head. On the second swing, the bottle shattered and sent glass shards flying across the bed. He continued swinging as hard as he could, opening the flesh on my face with the jagged edges of the bottle with increasing depth and frequency. Blood oozed from the wounds on my face, shifting around the remnants of the bottle that had lodged themselves in my cheek, forehead, and nose.

I woke up in the morning feeling pain-free, though disoriented. I tried to reach for my face, but my arms were abruptly cut short before they could reach their target. The clank of rattling metal accompanied a jolt that went throughout my shoulder, as I came-to and continued trying to pull my arms free of the chain-link binds. I was in a corner of the bedroom I had slept in the night before, attached to the wall by stainless steel chain to thick eye bolts that had been drilled into the studs in the wall. There was no breaking free of these no matter how much I struggled.

Jeff walked into the room playing hot potato with a bowl of oatmeal that had just come out of the microwave. He set the bowl on his nightstand while sliding a wooden chair across the floor and ate his breakfast, silently staring at me the entire time.

"Jeff?" I once again asked, although in a tone that you might say was whiny, "what's going on?"

"I killed you," he said, "I suffocated you with that pillow, drilled a hole through your skull, and took a butcher's cleaver to your arms."

I clearly still had arms. They were bound to the walls. I assumed he must be crazy, but I was still on the fence about how dangerous he might truly be.

"Well, buddy, as you can see I'm still fully formed. How about we let bygones be by-" he interrupted me by getting up and walking out of the room. When he came back, he was holding a large Ziploc bag, which he threw at me.

"No. I killed you," he threw the Ziploc bag at me. "I cut these off and browned the rest in a red wine reduction sauce with a bit of olive oil. Right now they're sitting in a Crockpot with a bit of onion, carrot, and potatoes. Seasonings too, of course. Mostly aromatics - cumin, garlic, paprika, nothing too fancy."

I looked at the Ziploc bag and immediately felt the disorientation and nausea from the night before hit me like a Willie Stargell power hit. Those were *my* hands. I looked over at the shackles to confirm - the ring I wore on my right index finger was no longer there, but it was in the bag. I had a scar on my palm from a bike accident when I was a kid that was no longer there, but was plain as day on the dismembered limb in this bag.

Jeff grabbed a roll of translucent shipping tape and walked over towards me. Although I pleaded for him not to do anything more, that I wouldn't go to the police, that I just wanted to go home, none of it mattered. He wrapped my entire head in packing tape, leaving no room for air to get in or out. I saw him walk out the front door and heard the lock turn before everything went black.

The world didn't come flooding back until some indiscernible amount of time later, when he unceremoniously ripped the tape from my head. He told me how excited he was at what I might be and how I was everything he had been looking for. He showed me the skulls from his previous attempts, Polaroids of the acts he had committed on them, and the trophies he had kept of his favorites. I could not help crying; whether out of pain, confusion, or agony, I couldn't be sure.

He told me he had spent years looking for his personal love zombie. Someone he could cherish and hold and have t
