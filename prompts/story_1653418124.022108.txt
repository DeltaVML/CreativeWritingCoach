STORY:

The cold porcelain began to make his ear go numb as his brain searched for an answer to what he just heard. "What?" Was all that could escape his quivering lips. 
 Xavieck never held his father in high regard, in fact, his opinion of his father was better left unsaid. Routine months of being left alone with his younger sister Annavia, returning with broken bones, busted lips and large packages that suddenly went missing were enough to grasp the work his father did. Although Xavieck knew he should be eternally grateful for even having a father, the cons of who his father was outweighed the pros. 

Xaviecks grasp on the phone uncomfortably tightened as he relayed his confusion of what he just heard.
"I'm sorry, did you say 'your highness' I must have heard you incorrectly?" 
A raspy grunt of a chuckle came from the white phone.
"No, your highness, you did not hear incorrectly and if we don't get you out right now, you and your sisters life could be lost. We're sending beams now!" 

A bright golden light suddenly appeared in the living room of their chidhood home. Annavias blue eyes grew large with fear as they met her brothers dark green eyes. Both looking just as confused as the other. Without warning, they found themselves in a large silver and gold room. The room seemed to be lit with a warm golden hue but there was no indication of light sources within the space. The smell of baked good filled the air as the sight of fuzzy furniture filled the space. It was as if the room was curated specifically for them. 

"Don't worry Annavia, I will find a way out of this!" He grabbed his sister's hand for support. In fact, this wasn't first time he had to grab her hand and keep her from danger. His life was a series of taking care of his sister. After their mothers death, their fathers episodes of leaving became longer. The desperate grief that filled both him and his sister's heart was what held them together as a family. The fact that he washed clothing, cooked meals, made lunches and got them both safely to and from places was enough to keep him from wanting to die. The feelings would come at night when he was lonely and silence engulfed the air. That was where he had no escape. No freedom. His fight was with the night. 

The sudden sound of boots brought Xavieck back to the reality of the moment. Two very large men, covered in gold plated armor arrived in the room. Both bowed deeply and repeated the same thing heard on the phone, "your highness' follow us" 

Both teens took in their surroundings as they entered a large meeting room. There was a table down the middle of the room and a man seated at the end. His large beard and gruff voice made Xavieck realize he was the man I. The white phone he talked with. His gruff voice boomed through the room "please sit down, we have a lot to discuss!" His hand pointing to the chairs. 

"We're not sure what exactly happened, could you tell us how your father got taken?" The man said with authority. Xavieckwas trying to take in this new situation as he stumbled through his words while sitting down in the oversized chair "what is going on, what is this place  and why are you calling us like we're royalty?" His body leaned forward to face the bearded soldier making direct eye contact. He noticed the way the soldier held himself. Not arrogantly but with a confidence that was unmatched by the likes of a teenage boy. He grinned with a smirk and said "surely questions like that are irrelevant while your father is in such danger?"
Xaviecks heart jumped at hearing his sister's high pitched response "danger, what kind of danger!?" 
The soldier turned to her and spoke matter- of -factly "Miss we cannot know how much or what kind of danger he's in until you tell us what happened?" 
Xavieck felt the pleading beg of his sister's eyes fall on him. Not wanting to look her way, he directed his voice to the soldier once more. This time mustering the most courage he could "you said 'your highness' now I demand you tell me what's going on or you....will...lose your rank!" He spoke with a booming force even he was shocked by.
The soldier shifted in his seat, not fully swayed by the threat. 

Suddenly, with the swiftness of a panther hunting his prey, the soldier pulled out what looked to be a gun, aimed without looking and sent a beam directly into Annavia. The speed mixed with the piercing scream of his sister sent a shockwave through his body. It was as if time slowed for a moment as he watched his sister fall to the ground, blood pouring out of his sister's core. With the weapon now aimed at him, xavieck couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. His mind seemed to be frozen. Frozen in a time where there was no escape. No relief. Where the pain of loss sunk deep into him. Where his heart was broken once again. Locked forever there.



"He seemed to be doing better this week doesn't he" the man spoke while rubbing his forehead with one hand. "Yes, he is doing better than before" the woman said with a ha
