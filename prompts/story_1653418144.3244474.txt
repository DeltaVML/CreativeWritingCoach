STORY:
================================

“Maximum level reached.”

The first thing I had done was punch the air in elation. After cracks spidered across my ceiling, I took more care in celebrating and looking through my newfound abilities.

I was stronger than I’ve ever been. Even though my body looked like the most typical, slightly pudgy 30-year-old you find walking down the street, there was considerable finesse and wonderful strength in every movement. A celebratory backflip was duly done, and walking up the stairs felt more like flying than labour.

But how? Full levels were millions of experience. Only a few people had ever achieved that number, usually involving killing. As far as I know, I’ve not killed a chicken, let alone legions of men and women.

I scanned the room with newfound clarity. My eyes saw more vibrant and bright colours, and seemed to absorb every piece of information my gaze flitted over. The drawer was the exact shade of bufous. On its top stood the things that I swore I would use sooner rather than later, and things that I swore I would put them away after a while. They now coexisted in the cramped space that was the top of my drawer.

For some reason, my eyes were drawn to the other side of the bed. I gingerly stepped over, until I saw the first shard of glass that poked out under the bed.,

There was a full-length mirror, once. It seemd to have met its greatest nemesis—the floor.

The mirror had shattered, countless pieces now lying on the floor. I saw manifold mes in each of them, staring back at me with the same, dawning realization reflected in my eyes.

My strongest enemy is myself. And I’ve destroyed it a thousand times over.

I reached out for a glass piece, barely noticing the sharp edge digging into my skin. A crimson drop of power splashed on the floor, practically glowing in the burgeoning sunlight.

Seven years of bad luck? Was that a superstition? Or was that for the people who vainly looked into a reflective surface every minute?

Or was it a way to keep something hidden?
