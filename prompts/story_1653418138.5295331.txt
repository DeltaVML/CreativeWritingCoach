STORY:

Cavalier Argonne stalked to the crude house. Noting the burned fields and and empty pasture. A kick to the door and he had to reel back as the kicked up dust left him coughing and sneezing. Staggering into the one room house he spied the two women living here. Still hastily packing.

"Thou shall not escape your due justice foul creatures!"

The elder so bent she seemed a crone laughed. "Probably easier than running at my age. Get on with it. I would see God while still righteous."

The words gave the knight pause a moment. "You deny being witches?"

The young one shook her head. "Fellis I will castrate you for those rumors if we survive this."

The crone cackles again. "Oh the bit on being witches is a bit over done. One of the lads didn't like being turned down by me granddaughter here. So he spread that story."

"So you claim innocence. Your fields and cattle. ."

"Cursed and possessed by demon kind. Put the cows down and burnt the fields. Our broom went missing and I am not sure I want to risk making another."

"The rumors are so farfetched. We go to temple every week with everyone else. We help our neighbors and ask naught in return. But suddenly they think us capable of this?"

"No witch could pull this blight upon the land ser knight. What magics they know are too shallow. The guardian of the fields has been possessed and the blood sown stalks are waiting to be reaped to infect other lands. Nine full moons. Never thought to question the count. Seek not a witch ser. Find the hidden maiden about to give birth. For she carries no messiah."
