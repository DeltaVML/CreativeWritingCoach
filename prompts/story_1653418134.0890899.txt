STORY:
================================

So there's this thing all new villains do, at the climax of each heist/crime/caper. It's brief, but it's distinctive, and you'll always find it if you know what you're looking for. When you've been around as long as I have, it's hard to miss.

It's a useful tell, if you're trying to identify which ones are actual villains, and which ones are just common criminals. It's like the standard superhero landing - lets you put a big tick in the box for 'actually part of the scene'. Older villains learn to avoid it after a while - it starts to feel a bit clich√©d - but for your new supervillains, it might as well be a neon sign.

It goes like this. The villain (plus optional henchmen) have busted in, probably made a few themed quips, and they've grabbed the object - money, experimental tech, girlfriend, whatever. That's phase one. Phase two is the fight - the hero turns up, starts knocking heads together, and they trade punches/puns for a bit.

At the climax of phase two, that's the moment. The villain has fought their way free, distracted the hero with a sacrificial minion or something. At that moment - on the edge of escape - they always pause. They stand, sillhouetted against the void portal, or the hole in the bank wall caused by a bus, or the open door of the helicopter, and they toss off one last line. 

That's it. Stand on the edge of escape, turn your head, say one thing, and then out. Into phase three - the chase - but for now lets just focus on the moment. They all do it, every time.

I've done it myself, as a youth. Back when I was starting out, I loved a good zinger as the subway doors closed in front of me, or even just a casual smirk as the submarine slips back beneath the water. It's hard to resist that moment of triumph.

But it's consistent, and that's a weakness. Just like the superhero landing again - when you know it's coming, you turn up a little early to the showdown and drop some mines at the base of the tallest building. The hero lands, punching the mine, and then you go home early because the cavalry is spread over a forty-foot area. I didn't get where I am today without exploiting an obvious weakness when the opportunity presents itself.

And that's what it's all about, really: where I am today. It's not that I begrudge any of the up-and-coming villains; you have to get your start somewhere. I've robbed my share of banks. But once you've robbed a few banks, you need somewhere to stash your money, and - call me old-fashioned - but I don't like upstarts just making off with what I've rightfully stolen.

So these days, I spend a lot of my time in the coffee shop across from the First National Bank. That's been my bank for thirty years, because it's the only one it ever took me more than 15 minutes to rob. I'm a loyal, if unconventional customer.

I like the coffee shop. There's a girl behind the register who reminds me of my granddaughter, they make a lovely lemon drizzle cake, and they don't mind if I just sit and do my crosswords with a pot of tea. It's a peaceful place to spend the day, and I don't have much else to do with my time since Maud passed. Perhaps most importantly though, the table where I sit has a perfect view of the large plate-glass windows fronting the bank.

A lot of villains try to rob that bank. A lot of heroes try to stop them. If the heroes were better at stopping them, I wouldn't spend quite as much time drinking tea which - given my bladder - does me no favours. But no -  the heroes all arrive a little too late, don't quite hit hard enough to stop the villain escaping.

But new villains are consistent, and none of them - not one - can resist those big windows. They just have to use them as their exit, bust through them with some strange ray gun or vehicle. And then, as they're about to get away - scott-free, with my money - they do the thing.

They pause, for just a second, in the exact centre of whatever breach they've made. They turn, toss their head back, say something cutting. They stop moving, for just a heartbeat longer than they should.

I'm an old man now. I feed the ducks in the park, and wear scarves even in summer. I drink my tea and do my puzzles and the coffee shop staff call me an 'old dear' when they think I'm not listening. But you don't get to be old in this game without learning, and keeping, a few tricks.

In that frozen moment, when the villain is still, and sillhouetted, I've got a perfect shot. A death ray - silent, invisible, disguised as my lucky crossword pen. All it takes is a tap. The villain stumbles, falters, falls. The hero grapples with the mistaken belief that they've somehow taken a life. The bank workers collect up my money and put it back in the vault.

The doctors say I should watch my blood sugar. But on days when I've foiled a robbery, saved the city, protected my granddaughter's inheritance, I allow myself another slice of cake.
