STORY:

WARNING: VEILED ADULT HUMOR AND INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT 18+ RECOMMENDED 

Was this some kind of alternate dimension? Did I fall down some kind of rabbit hole??

I held my breath as I walked through the lobby. Keep your facial features to a minimum, remember it's a mask. The others had told me that this is the reason why they chose this month every year to hold the first year's shifting ceremony. But this was ridiculous.

The first shift for a werewolf was always difficult. It wasn't exactly the shift to becoming a werewolf that was difficult, did it hurt? Absolutely! The pain was tremendous. It honestly was the changing back. The pain was excruciating as muscles, bones and sinew shorted or lengthened depending on your size and shape. Some of the kids stayed in their shifted forms afraid that they wouldn't survive the first shift back. They were shipped off to Romania some chose the alps..... others the carpathian mountains.

My attention was snapped back to the present as a brightly colored Serval stepped into my path. Most of the kids dressed up were here to entertain and make people laugh, just plain kids enjoying their fursona. Possibly coming out of a shell that they are normally trapped in, maybe their anxiety and fear of rejection disappeared when they put that suit on because they knew they were part of a tribe. This was a refuge for kids who felt like they belonged nowhere in the world, but here...... On these days this kid/adult could finally let out their inner little monster and go Absolutely bananas and not fear the repercussions because there were like minds around.. There was no connotation to the other.... more taboo side of things. Until she crossed his path.

"I've been looking for one of you....." she whispered under her breath. 
"A wolf and a serval?" I uttered back, mocking her notion that I would venture that far with a different pedigree. She laughed and suddenly I felt my human side take notice, a light airy sound very pleasing to my senses. I began to notice other things as well. She had a shapely form. Large, full and looked like firm up top and bottom with a smaller waist. She was taller than most women standing at least six foot. She walked around me and grabbed my tail in her hand, close to the base she squeezed her thumb and index fingers tight around the circumference then closed the rest of her hand around it. Then ever so slowly she ran her closed fist down the full length of my tail. It was then that I smelled her, her scent flooded my nose in an absolutely primal way and I fought to keep my features placid.

"YOU!!" I exclaimed as quiet as I could. She was one of us. Dressed like the others she spun around in front of me and pressed her chest against my stomach and rubbed her soft furry paws over my chest, then dropping lower. She gripped my fuzzy coin purse in one fuzzy paw and I couldn't stop the growl of desire that rippled through me. She laughed again and released me as she danced out of reach and the rest of them flooded around me.

"Your fursona looks so real!!"
"Who was your maker??"
"How much did the faux fur cost??"
"Where does the noise come from??"

And a thousand different questions were thrown at my head. I quickly excused myself and got away from the crowd.

Now I was on the hunt.

I could smell her and to make it all that much worse she was in her time of needing..... and she was an unclaimed female. So there would be competition for her affections.

She would be mine.

I thought I had subconsciously snarled.... that was until yet another flood of multicolored furries ran at me like I had a jingle toy. I quickly avoided them and finally found my prey, she was talking to two other Servals and waved at me cheekily. I stomped right over and found that these were in fact also more of the werewolf females, in human form..... in changed form.

"There are males dressed here as well." She whispered for my ears only. "We figured if we can't beat them, join them. Plus. What's the harm in making the humans think that they have everything figured out and that some of the people here just have a taste for the taboo." She ran her hand from the inside of my thigh, around my fuzzy coin purse then my breath caught in my throat as she caressed my....

"And that kids is the actual story of how your mother and I got together. The shifting ceremony is still held during furry events for just that reason."

As always I apologize for my horrible grammar, or lack there of. I hope you enjoyed the read anyways.
