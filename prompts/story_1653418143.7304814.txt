I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The project was universally holocasted. The same beautiful, busty blond sat on a chair in nearly every household speaking to the occupants like a trusted friend. In some households she held up the likeness of the reality-jumper, sometimes exploding it into separate parts and reassembling it into a skittering mechanical beetle. In some houses, she watched with the rest of the occupants as the image of a screen showed a well-known video, the mechanical beetle skittering along a concrete floor, empty save yellow and black stripped caution lines. As people watched it, they found themselves following the motion of something no longer there. 

In the majority of households, people watched an empty concrete floor, now fully spread across the floor as if it were in each of their houses, its black and yellow caution lines faded to charcoal and pastel hues, but still eyes watched, waiting to catch movement of something not truly there yet. If the room was large enough, black ominous barrels pointed at the floor, a reminder of the distrust reality jumping brought. Few houses showed the mangled bodies of a century ago, scientists that unknowingly gave their lives for their arrogance. In all houses, above the young woman's head, a timer counted down. 

In some houses, clips of an alien world jumped into vision, surviving footage of early jumps. Before reality-jumping was outlawed, before the war, before the insurrection, before the public release of the last probe, before the average citizen accepted that it couldn't be stopped. Now people could only wait and stare at a concrete floor and see what horror followed the bug home. A silence crept up, even the young woman spoke less, her answers and thoughts becoming terse, but at 0:00:00, no bug appeared. There was no movement in any house, on any floor, nothing came or left. There was no sigh of relief or gunshots, the entire world lay as still as a mechanical bug, shattered in a forgotten cave, its mission having been failed not even a week from when it began.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
