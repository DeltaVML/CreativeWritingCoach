I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My dragon courage gives me the strength to go to the beach tomorrow. I take off my human shirt and the beautiful bikini clad women look at my buff dragon body in awe. I nervously gulp and let out a little unsure grin. The girls flock to me like seagulls to a hot dog, my hot dog. It gets very steamy and I’m with 4 beautiful women of all different races and then I see my crush since I was 4, Vanessa. She’s shocked of my new dragon body, but I look her in the eyes with my different colored dragon eyes and I tell her “I love you”. We then fly off into the sky and I take her to a hotel and we make love and we both win prom king and queen a few weeks later. The End

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
