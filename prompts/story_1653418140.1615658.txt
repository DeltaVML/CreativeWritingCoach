I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================


Flashes of lighting, super speed, control over the ocean waves - with powers like these, my fellow superheroes save millions of human lives from their demise. I, on the other hand, save millions of human AND animal lives. 

From water to air, pollution happens to be one of the biggest, and slowest, factors to all lives on earth meeting their end. Luckily, I have the power to "undo" these issues - To a certain extent, for a small amount of time.

"What are you gonna do? Give them flowers?" They laugh. They'd bicker on, and on, and on about the things I could do. I'll admit, I'm jealous of the power they held. Despite this, I'm glad I didn't end up like them. With great power comes a narcissist.

One day, I returned home to a strange sight. I try to water my plants when needed, and though I really try, my plants always seem to wither and dry out. This day, I came home to my plants alive and VERY healthy. Confused, yet intrigued, I staggered to my bedroom and shut the door. 

My eyes shut themselves to the feeling of my mattress like a venus flytrap would to a fly. My slumber approached quick, and the world faded away.

Garbled and jumbled words bounced around me, bold and reverberated. A blurry symphony of colours waved at my tired eyes. As my sight regained, I saw Demeter, a face whom I last saw years ago. 

"It's nice to see you again, child," She spoke, a playful smile on her face. I gave a laugh, rolling my eyes at the nature goddess.

"Why do they not accept me?" I asked, longing for the respect and praise from my fellow heroes. 

"I give you my strength. Beware the consequences of your actions." Without another word, she placed a finger against my head. 

Like a gust of wind, I was hit with a sudden wave of strength. I gasped and clawed at the grass as my lungs desperately circulated oxygen back into my system. The grass I plucked from their muddy follicles begin to shrivel to a disgusting brown, and the ground beneath me caves in.

I woke up in a sweat, my chest heaving from within. My day continued on as usual, my morning routine involving me cleaning myself up. As I peered into my fridge, the eggs in the carton did not look so appetizing anymore.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I was now on the same level as those self-addicted superheroes, but I noticed that I was changing.

My brittle, dark hair turned brown and stiff. My chocolate-coloured eyes, into green pools of chlorophyll. My skin became flakey, and on my pillow was a confetti of leaves. The more I used my powers, the more noticeable these changes became.

Demeter visited me once again, to reverse the state of the effects as she had seen I was unhappy. She warned me again, this time of something I was not so appalled by.

"You will return to the life you had before my power was given to you."

I've stopped listening to the jokes and heckles, and instead, I dedicated my life to growing plants and helping out with environmental studies. 

I guess all along, I was looking for validation in the wrong place.
