STORY:
================================

Had a lot of momentum. Had a good idea. Kinda fizzled out but I think I put a good spin on it.


Agamemnon screamed as the wizards chanted around him. The circle drawn underneath his feet started glowing with a bright purple light. His eyes burned and his skin tingled. Holy water was sprayed on him from a firehose. A group of priests stood nearby blessing the firetruck. 

He roared again, shouting curses, “I will destroy you all! I will come back more powerful than ever! Your children’s children will not be able to defeat me!”

No one listened. They ignored his empty threats and the chanting rose. The purple light became too bright from him.  The holy water was melting his skin. Agamemnon was… losing. He was losing. He was an upper level demon with a heap of conquests under his belt yet this small town of simpletons was besting him. The ground shook and opened up beneath his feet. He grasped the ledge with his claws, desperate to stay in this realm. Even for a demon, hell was horrible.

One of the priests stepped up to the outer edge of the circle, his voice booming, “GO BACK FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!”

Agamemnon knew it was over. The ledge crumbled beneath his claws and he fell into the dark fiery hole as holy water and purple light ate his body like acid. The smell of sulfur rose high in the air around him. He was humiliated. Agamemnon had been unconquerable and now he was defeated. He roared in ager but as he did, his voice lost the ominous deep raspy tones and became high and squeaky. He sounded like a woman, nay a young girl. There wasn’t much time to contemplate this sudden change because then he hit the ground. 

It wasn’t painful, just discombobulating. He sat up, clutching his head and looking around. He expected to see a bunch of lesser demons standing around and laughing at him but instead he was greeted by silent trees. Agamemnon sniffed the air, assuming this was some sort of punishment but the smell of sulfur was gone. He wasn’t in hell anymore.

He stood up slowly, expecting to be in pain from the holy water that had burned like acid. Instead, he was better than ever, only a few scrapes and bruises on his pristine caramel skin. He frowned and poked at it. Skin? SKIN? Agamemnon was a greater demon with black scales and large muscles but now he had skin and no muscle mass. He held his arms out in front of him and turned them around this way and that. 

His mind spun. No way. Absolutely not. Was he… was he human???????”

He let out a roar in frustration but it came out feminine and squeaky. His eyes widened and he felt his head and body. Long soft hair? SOFT hair? No spikes? No scales? Boobs? A pink t-shirt with a bow on it? No leather armor? Just one dirty sneaker, tight shorts that squeezed his tummy too tight and a PINK t-shirt. Agamemnon HATED pink. No no no. This was all so wrong. He wished he was in hell right now facing his humiliation because this was a nightmare!

Shouts rose in the distance, “Mina! Mina where are you?”

Against his will, he shouted back in this new feminine voice, “I’m here! Mom? Dad?”

Agamemnon wanted to run away but his legs carried him towards the voices. A woman with long fake blonde hair and alabaster skin appeared out of nowhere and ran up, hugging him, “Oh Mina! Mina where have you been? What happened to your shoe? You’ve been gone for hours. Are you hurt sweetie?”

“Mom, I’m fine,” he insisted, still confused about this new development. 

Was he in someone else’s body? He tried to take control like he was possessing someone but something prevented him. He pushed back harder and his legs collapsed underneath him.

The blonde lady, mom, hovered, “Mina! Oh Dave! Dave get over here! Call 911! Something’s wrong with Mina.”

“I’m fine,” he insisted, standing back up. “Just give me a soul and I will recover my strength.”

Dave came into view and hugged him, “Mina! Mina, my darling!”

He frowned, “Dad?”

The caramel skinned man grinned with a set of blinding white teeth, “Yes honey?”

“Oh, okay,” he said, his tongue poking around his mouth looking for his sharp canines. “So I’m not adopted?”

Both “parents” frowned at him and the mom spoke, “Honey, no. You’re ours through and through. Did you hit your head?”

Agamemnon frowned, “Yes. I did. And I fell. Bring me food. I need sustenance.”

Dave hugged her, “Yes honey, we can get some of that chicken salad you like on the way home.”

He pulled back, hating the close contact and started walking in a random direction, “Chicken salad? I want a burger.”

Mom caught up with him, “But honey you don’t eat beef. Remember?”

He glared at her, “I do now.”
