I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“It’s morphin time!!” The jock yelled “tyrannosaurus!” 

The football captain immediately transformed into a red and white spandex suit with a motorcycle helmet on. 

The emo kid morphed next “umm it’s morphing time?” He turns out to be gay so nothing happens. “Damnit billy,” Zach scoffed. “You have to use the pink ranger powers, we couldn’t get a white girl so you have to say pterodactyl” 

“Mastodon!” Zach yelled as he transformed into a black on black Cadillac Escalade with 22 inch rims and 10% tint on the windows. He bellowed “black ranger in this bitch!” And cracked all 4 windows to release a powerful cloud of blunt smoke to confuse the enemies and limit their visibility.

The Asian girl turns to me and say “hurry up and buy!” I said wtf?  She repeated “I say hurry up I’m bi!” I asked her to repeat again “why u no transform????” 

Honestly this shit is weird guys I’m going home.  I threw the morphing coin down but just then a ray of green light hit my chest “oh shit boy I’m bout to get jiggy with it low key” Billy muttered “fax” in agreement.  I transformed into Jason David Frank the actor who played the green ranger with a celebrity net worth of about $5 mil.  I immediately drove to the bank and withdrew everything, invested it all into crypto and it got stolen.  After that I walked around the mall hoping kids would notice me. “I’m the green ranger, remember power rangers?”  No response. “Shut up boomer im buying Roblox bucks you complete pussy”. Okay whatever I’m going to go have sex with Kimberly.  But then I pick up my cell phone and press it to my face and suddenly it’s 1996. I’m the white ranger now and I’m about 28 years old.  I decide to stay in the 90’s and let the other 4 kids die because I’m going to do the butterfly effect to ruin everything. I’m investing $1000 in Apple, Microsoft, and Google and nobody can tell me shit.  When Bitcoin comes out I’m gonna buy a fuck load of it and try not to pre-jac when it hits $19k in 2016. By then I’ll be rich as fuck anyway. I get bored of being rich and decide to grab a gig as a high school history teacher since I’m an expert on changing the timeline.  

One day class is about to get out and I see this new kid get grabbed by 4 random others and they say “you’re our fifth, no time to explain” then they dragged him into the boys locker room and circle jerked. I’m like wtf? I thought this was a power rangers movie and isn’t one of the 4 an Asian girl?  Well I changed timelines so she’s actually transitioned now. And Google turned out to be evil and they got cancelled for saying that anime was gay.  

The end.
