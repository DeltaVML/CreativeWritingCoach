STORY:

"... after my mother died I felt there was no one who really knew me, you know?" 

I lifted my head from my notes, startled by the realization that I had almost no recollection of the current session

I jerked back into a state of awareness as Blanche let Mrs. Ashburn in for her 2:30 appointment. Feeling as though something was not quite right, that perhaps I had forgotten something, I checked the notes I had left open on my desk. 

In an unrecognized yet determinedly feminine handwriting were just 3 words.
