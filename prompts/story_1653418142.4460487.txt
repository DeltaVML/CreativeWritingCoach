I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Ibn-Azar stomped into the torture chamber, where I was painfully stretched out on the rack he'd secured me to after my capture by his minions. He slammed a book down on the table  by the rack, and it fell open atop the torturer's instruments, displaying a couple sketches  I'd made.

"What the hell is *this?"* he demanded, angrily.

I glanced down, gritting my teeth through the pain. "Errrgh...that would be my *spellbook,* obviously."

He jabbed a finger at the open tome. "That is a not *spellbook.* That is a book that you've filled with sketches of..." the scraggly old wizard glanced at the open book, and then back at me. "...rabbits and warthogs!"

"I know what's in it." I said, defensively. "That's how I write spells down."

"No it's not!" Ibn-Azar insisted. "Spells are incredibly complex arcane formulae, each made up of dozens of runes, sigils, and figures of mystical geometry! That's why you have to write them down and *study* them for a few hours daily, so they're always fresh in your memory! You can't just draw *a bunny!*"

I shook my head. "That's not how it works for me. It wouldn't matter how long I studied something like that, it would never stick my head for more than a minute or two. I've got a memory like a *sieve,* I'm afraid. No, spells are more like...a *feeling,* for me, you know?"

"No, I don't *know!"* he snapped. "Magic isn't about *feelings,* or wishes, or the power of bloody *friendship!*  It's an arcane science! Where's your *real* spellbook, damn you?! You're not even thirty years old, but I've seen you cast spells I've never even *heard of!* I *must* learn this magic!"

"Ohhh," I said, nodding. "So that's why all the minions, and the cudgeling me in my sleep, and chaining me up in a torture chamber?"

"Yes, obviously." he replied, through gritted teeth.

I sighed. "Sorry, I don't think I can help you, Zar-Zar. My magic isn't something you can teach. You just kinda have to *get it.*"

He glowered at me, dangerously. "You had better hope you're *wrong,* boy, because I've barely *begun* to 'persuade' you to share your knowledge."

"Alright, alright!" I exclaimed, hastily, as he reached for the crank that would stretch me out further on the rack. "I'll *try,* okay?"

He rested his hand on the crank, but didn't start turning it, yet. "Start talking!"

"So," I began, sighing with relief. "The first thing you should know is that my magic comes from my imagination -- I just see the spell *in my head."*

He nodded slowly. "So, you're some sort of *idiot savant?* Well, that makes a bit more sense."

I shot him a disgruntled look. "I think just plain old *savant* would be a perfectly good term to use, but sure, I guess that applies. More or less."

He looked down at my spellbook, brow furrowed. "But then, where does the book come in? If it's all in your head, why draw the pictures at all?"

"Ah," I said, brightly. "That's the clever part! See, if I want to imagine the same spell twice, I need to *feel* the way I felt when I imagined it the first time. So I draw pictures that make me *feel* that way."

He placed his hands on his hips. "You mean to tell me you prepare your spells each day, by studying pictures of *animals* for hours?"

I shook my head. "Nah, I don't really need to *study* them. Just looking for a minute is enough to for me to get the feel of it, and imagine the spell. Once I've got it in my head, I'm good to go. I don't even *need* my wand, really."

He blinked in confusion. And then his eyes widened, and he reached for his own wand.

Before he could draw his arcane implement, I blurted out a string of syllables I didn't understand, and cast one of the spells in my open book. Wizard, robe, wand, and all, transformed into a fluffy gray bunny rabbit.

Then I cast another spell, to make me really tough and strong, like a big old *warthog*. I snapped the restraints holding me, and slid off the rack onto the floor, with a groan of relief. I frowned down at Ibn-Azar, who was staring at me, and making angry little squealing sounds.

If I turned him back, he'd return exactly as he'd been when I cast the spell, with his hand already on his wand. Then he'd probably zap me with something nasty. So, with a sigh, I picked up my spellbook under one arm, tucked the squirming Ibn-Azar under the other, and headed for the door.

I guess I have a *pet rabbit* to take care of, now.
