STORY:
================================

here the thought of a 2020 word generator THIS IS NOT MINE THIS IS A WORD GENERATOR CREDIT GO TO INFERKIT :  
" An AITA post from a supervillain desperate to be told they're doing the right thing.  
Volcano  
In March, I wrote about the lack of diplomacy by the AITA and the Indian board in the past week, when they couldn't even wait for the Indonesia results to be out before they called the team for the tie. The ITA, who aren't happy that the ties, originally scheduled in December, have been brought forward by a month, has decided that they want India to host the tie, even though the Indian team wasn't selected, for reasons that the tournament president didn't fully understand in a Reddit AMA.  
But this is a perfectly normal and understandable stand for the ITF to take. What's not is that a tennis federation decide to change the rules of an international tournament at the last minute on the teams of their junior players, after they had started their respective seasons.  
The ITA, to their credit, have issued a public apology to the Indian Davis Cup team. AITA have set up a committee to look into the matter and, hopefully, to get the right outcome.  
But one outcome it isn't: No Davis Cup tie at home in 2019.  
So What's New  
The Indian men's hockey team is facing World Cup Qualification. If they fail to qualify for the World Cup, it is the first time India will miss a World Cup since 2002.   
The England women's hockey team have, of course, not lost a single match since the Hockey Women's World League Final last year. In 2018, England has been ruthless, winning the Asia Cup and winning the Commonwealth Games gold. As if that was not enough, they did it without ever having a single goal disallowed.  
But who is topping that list? No one, no one is. It is India. The men's team is sitting in a playoff spot in the Asia Cup and a semifinal spot in the Hockey World League Semifinal (qualification for next year's World Cup). The women's team has earned an automatic spot in the World Cup by finishing second in the HWL Final. What more would you like?

Marketing The Next Gen  
Vijay Amritraj was one of the main champions of bringing the Indian juniors to Pune for the Tata Open.  
With Vijay Amritraj as one of the main champions of the event, and with the support of the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), the India Open is now a bigger deal than it was before.  
With the WTA's under-14 girls and boys championships (funded by the World Group and the ITF) being held at the Pune Tennis Academy, the tournament has now been given a bigger visibility. The tournament has also helped to give some much-needed employment opportunities to the young players.  
At the net-work at the Tata Open, Amritraj also discussed a big change in tennis in India: the dearth of marketing and advertising, even as the sport gets more and more popular.  
Krishnan and Amritraj talk  
"We have been very lucky with the advertising companies in India. It has been fantastic," Amritraj told ESPN. "The whole trend of tennis is going back to the amateur days with marketing and visibility. We are struggling a little bit to find the right marketing message. We have the best players, we have a great game and we have a very huge fan base in the country. We need to package it in a way to get out the right message."  
Amritraj said that it was important to market the sport well so that it doesn't get overrun by too many junior players. "When there are 12 players in the ITF ranking who are all very good but do not get a chance to play top-100 players, they are not prepared for top-100 players. So we need to package it in the right way," he said.  
Amritraj said the game was going through a process where players are getting younger and younger. He said that the growth of tennis in India was an important step for the sport. "The whole sport is getting younger. It is exciting for us to see."  
Meanwhile, Ramesh Krishnan was found speaking to Ashishkumar Singh on Facebook Live about the making of Bajirao Mastani. Singh is the marketing manager of Dharma Productions. He said he heard Krishnan comment on the promotion of Bajirao Mastani, and so he got in touch. A friendship followed and they now talk about everything from world events to movies.
