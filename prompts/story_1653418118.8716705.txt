STORY:
================================

I was born in japan, on the night of a full moon. And on a night just like my birth, my village was slaughtered by a ruthless sorcerer. He commanded a ruthless army of shikigami. I was twelve years old when I hid with my mother in the forest temple. The temple of the mountain god.
  

  
I prayed for the power to do something, the strength to fight back against this sorcerer and his powerful army of shikigami. I heard my father choke to death on his own blood, and watched my mother beheaded while defending me. I felt her warm blood on my face and stared into her lifeless eyes.
  

  
That's when I saw it appear next to me. The mountain kami, it was terrible, thousands of eyes covering a human shaped black hole of a person. Four armed, winged, ears on its head like a hare. Gaping mouths all over its torso. It reached for my hand, I didn't know what to do, so I grabbed hold, hoping it would help me.
  

  
That night I killed over a hundred shikigami. The sorcerer, the mountain kami inside of me consumed him. That was the night I discovered monsters were real, and that we worshipped them.
  

  
But there are far worse things out there. I can name them, each and every one. The kami tells me their names, what they are, and we destroy them.
  

  
My mother, a yuki onna, still haunts me. She guides me, warns me. And the mountain god is still here with me. Since that day when it entered my body, people call me “Usagi sama.” I am the vengeful hare at night, and by day I am Kohaku Yamazaki.
  

  
I was trained as a samurai from age thirteen by Ishikawa sensei. Until one of my peers killed him, and then I became a rounin at the age of eighteen.



  
I caught up to Ikeda not long after. He thought he could stop me by cutting off my hand, but in his hubris and laughter, he found out that I was not the man I appeared to be. My hand reformed itself, and without my sword, I tore Ikeda's head from his body. I left it as a warning in the town square with the words, “betrayer of his sensei” written in ink on his kimono.
  

  
This kami, it has claimed my soul. I've fought snake women thousands of times my size. I've killed yokai that crush men in one hand. I've eviscerated highway spirits that trick travellers into giving them a ride, only to kill them. And the truth is, I think I'm becoming the monster. Perhaps I've always been a monster, as much as villagers cheer, “Usagi sama! You saved us!” and “Usagi sama, the hero!”
  

  
I don't know rest. I can't comprehend what it's like to not live like a vagabond. To not beg, and take up shelter with strangers. I long for the embrace of another human being. I can't rest, not with this yokai inside of me. It craves blood and violence in the night; while I crave my mother speaking reassurances.
  

  
Sometimes I do hear her at night. But it's torture, knowing that she's as damned as I am. Trapped in a place between. I know it won't let me die. I should've died countless times before. I've been bisected by the axe of an oni. Exsanguinated by the claws of a vengeful yurei. And even beheaded by a possessed samurai.
  

  
It's been well over a thousand years of this now. This spirit won't let me die. Together we are the vengeful Usagi sama. Destroyer of ghosts, eater of vile spirits, exterminator of things that lurk and take human life.
  

  
The kami inside me comes to me at night. Often in the shape of a beautiful woman, sometimes as a man. I've hated it. I hated the hell it had put me through. I wished my life would end.
  

  
As much as I have hated Shion, the former mountain god. They have brought me the comfort I need to continue. I still long for death, for rest. But now I long for them when I die. I long for the embraces that they have given me, the soft comfort. The whispers of Shion's voice are everything.
  

  
And so I will continue fighting, until the day when Shion chooses to free me from living. Until we can be together in the spirit world.
