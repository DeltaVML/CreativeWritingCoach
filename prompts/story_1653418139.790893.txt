STORY:
================================

"Hey, look! I think we're passing by France right now!", Sheila said, giggling, as she looked out the panel window of transparent aluminium. "We'll always have Paris, Jay", she added, with a mock mellow voice.

"Oh, shut up, Shay", he grunted, placing boxes at the moving drawers. He really, really needed to pee, but the overseer drone was in their sector right now. Jeremy was holding strong, as he really didn't want to have to sully his overtainted overalls, as instructed by the HR ministry.

They lived and worked onboard Amazon Prime, ruler and protector of Earth. The A.I. system that regulated everything sat inside the quantum supercomputer at the core of the thousands feet tall mecha body of a Valkyrie-type warrior that roamed the continents collecting resources and dispatching millions of delivery drones from its built-in warehouses.

Amazon Prime was technically the largest and richest nation on the planet. In a night without smog, you could with see the hole left on the moon to build it with a naked eye.

The overseer woop-wooped to indicate it was rotating watch spots. It was Jeremy's chance.

"Igottagorealquick", he uttered to Sheila, as he ran off to to one of the very few webcam blindspots they had discovered so far. Of course f\*\*\*ing Dwayne was already there. So Jeremy pushed aside a panel and went into a maintenance tube. "Screw it", he thought, as he crawled while unzipping his uniform, with an ancient plastic bottle in hands.

As he relieved himself, he noticed something weird in the tangle of wires and exposed circuitboards around him. That passage was never meant for people, only repair drones. So why would a book be sitting here?

"Unionize Now!", said the cover. Jeremy was still filling the bottle with dark colored Fanta. He had been holding it for way too long.

"Huh!", he whispered to himself. "Unio--", he could not finish talking. Loud alarms sounded all over Amazon Prime, as it reverted to Defcon 1. Automated messages flooded the screens, instructing workers to return to their quarters and wait. Jeremy was holding his ears, trying to endure the sensory assault of the robot's alarm system. He still hadn't finished, so he wet himself anyway.

There was great anxiety in Cardboard Town once again. The elders feared another full rotation of personel was on the way.
