I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

When people ask me what kind of person I am, I always stumble. How can one explain their inner personalities so easily? Some are "confident" some are not, some are good at something, some are not, some are "mature" some are "childish", some are evil, some are good, some believe in a thing, some dont... Yet, no one truly follows their ideals. Sometimes people say they're sensitive, but no one can truly empathize with everything and everyone. When it comes to it, being something is way harder than what people make it out to be. Even I, although am saying I cannot describe myself, it is impossible to not choose an identity. Maybe that's why we have these skins. Our virtual bodies. Regardless of who we really are, I've always believed we've created this simulation to be able to believe in an identity. 

That's why ever since I'd heard about the RE-ASSIGNMENT I'd been keeping this awkward smile of confusion while checking my watch every other minute for the time to hit 00:00.

I looked at the mirror, trying to imagine how I would actually look like. I wondered whether this awkward smile was childish or mature.

I looked at my watch. Then I kept looking at myself. Then I looked at my watch. Then I looked at myself again. And then I looked at my watch again.

Then I looked at myself. There I was. The lovecraftian monster that I am. The something.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
