STORY:

Arrival in 5… 4… 3… 2…1
  

  
I unslung my lazer pistol, checking my vitals to make sure I was breathing proper oxygen levels. All stable.
  

  
It was cramped, among all the cargo, but it was the only way I could sneak in. As we landed I waited patiently in the darkness. Then I heard footsteps. Time for the inspection.

There was only one escape pod left.
  

  
“No, dammit, no!” I screamed.
  

  
“There is only room for one of us.” K8-7TC stated, “I was ordered to protect you. I am just a machine. You’re of flesh and blood. Death means much more to you than I.”
  

  
I shook my head, “I can’t leave you, K. And don’t you dare ever say that. Your life is worth a whole lot more than mine. With all the times you’ve laid your life on the line for me. Your database has saved our asses more times than I can count by finding some obscure way to get out of whatever idiotic situation I got us in.”
  

  
“I understand your sorrow, but I cannot allow you to give yourself up like this. Your story isn’t over. You will build another automaton that will serve you better than I. My functions are outdated compared to the latest models.”
  

  
“I don’t care about that! You’re more than a bucket of bolts, K. You’re lively, caring, and warm. The world needs you, it doesn’t need me, without you, I’d already be dead.”

I waited patiently as the officers moved through the small craft, scrutinizing the vessel’s contents. They approached my position. Closer and closer they came. I readied my weapon, counting down. 3… 2… 1…
  

  
I leaped out of my hiding position and unleashed a spray of lazer bolts at the officers, blast holes burning through their chests. I ran to the vessel’s control panel, closing the doors and activating its weapon systems, firing on all the officers on the dock.
  

  
They attempted to retaliate, but in a mixture of surprise, chaos, and the thick shell of the cargo ship, they could do little to stop me. A single button press, that was all it took to end them. One after the other, officers began falling, blast holes covering their bodies. The room went quiet.

“We’re running out of time,” K noted, “I will not debate this any longer, you’re getting in that pod.”
  

  
I took up a defensive stance, glaring at them, “Make me.”
  

  
They tried to push me into the pod but I dodged out of the way, trying to continue their forward push momentum to hurl them into the pod but K stopped themself in time. They spun around, rushing toward me, but I was ready once more, rolling out of the way.
  

  
I blinked, they kept rushing. What was K doing? My eyes widened as they reached the control panel and pressed it, the chamber beginning to fill with gas. I coughed and wheezed, trying to keep as much air in my lungs as I could and as much of the fumes out, but it was no use.
  

  
I desperately grasped at them, trying to shove them into the pod, but my body grew weaker by the moment. “No!” I croaked, then I noticed their deactivation switch. I squeezed my eyes shut to hold back tears. K had told me how much they hated that switch, what it felt like to be shut off. I didn’t want it to come to this, but I had to make sure they lived.
  

  
With my remaining energy I leaped on their back, ripping open their control panel and looking for the switch, but K threw me off of it before I could complete my attempt. K tuned to me, “I cannot allow you to decommission me, my priority is your survival.”
  

  
I felt my eyelids grow heavy as I stumbled onto the ground, losing consciousness.

I raced through the halls. After I cleared out the loading dock I borrowed one of the officer’s outfits, but that disguise had only lasted so long. I now turned a corridor, firing at my pursuers.
  

  
I went over the floor plans in my head. It was close, they had to be there. They had to be.
  

  
I threw an energy grenade behind me, blasting the archway behind me causing it to collapse, preventing the officers from pursuing me. I raced into the brig, checking each cell.
  

  
Not here. Not here. Where are they…. then I opened it, the cell door as lifeless as any other, but behind it was a most welcome sight.
  

  
“Don’t you ever do that again, K. You understand?” I rushed up to them, embracing the automaton as my eyes grew weepy, “Now let’s get out of here. Blast… I’m so glad you’re alright.”
