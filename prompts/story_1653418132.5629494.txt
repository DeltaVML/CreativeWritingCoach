I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The kindest of people have the darkest of pasts…

It was a sweet summer evening, the sun was out the clouds for once didn’t fill the sky with dread and rain… It was a surreal day as if a famous painter had constructed the sky…
But the days don’t represent a persons feelings, they don’t bend and twist to the horrors one must suffer. Because  the world doesn’t revolve around anyone.

This was one of those days. I could feel my intensities wrap around my neck and be hunged in front of the sun my innards grabbed by the beast that was over joyed at my “Death” My eyes didn’t close though… My soul hadn’t rest I was still breathing despite my broken neck despite being tossed around on the ground despite my flesh burning in what felt like magma ….I couldn’t feel the bliss of death I couldn’t feel the waning of my soul… The only thing waning was my body and my sanity…
