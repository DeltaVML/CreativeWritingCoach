STORY:
================================

Time Traveler’s Log Day 1: I actually did it! I found a way to go back in time! Finally, those days of despair and pain are over. I will have her back, I just need to get her away from that spot. I missed her so, but today, that all changes!
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 2: It appears this will be trickier than I expected. In order to prevent a paradox, I cannot interact with her while in the past. I have to indirectly find a way to get her away by moving objects, hiding things, and so forth. Let’s hope this works.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 4: While I can’t interact with her, I can at least see her again. It has been so long since I’ve gazed upon her countenance. Since I have heard her melodious laugh. Since she has been alive. I finally have hope now, and I’ll do whatever I can to bring her back.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 7: I’ve hidden keys, locked doors, moved purses, and yet she still ends up in the same spot each time. No matter, the answer is somewhere, and I will find it.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 12: I’m beginning to believe there is something more drawing her to that spot than mere chance. Is it fate? No, it can’t be, I’ve invented time travel, I am above fate. She just happens to stand there a lot is all, something in the subconscious perhaps. But I will solve this, I have to.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 20: I can leave notes! Ha! Why did I not think of this before? That won’t upset the timeline as long as it doesn’t contradict what past me has done or said. But what do I say? I can’t say don’t stand in that spot, no, that would arouse too much suspicion. Maybe something like 'buy milk?' To get her in a different place? Perhaps.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 30: Shopping notes don’t work, she prioritizes the activity that gets her to the spot. I need something more urgent, maybe something just to delay her a little more. Remind her to call someone?
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 45: They aren’t enough. I thought I was onto something with those notes. The right answer is there, I just have to find it. Maybe if I combine some of the attempts I’ve put into practice earlier I can delay her long enough this time. There is still hope.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log Day 60: Why didn’t I think of this before, I could call her! Again, as long as it doesn’t interfere, it's not direct interaction. I can do a similar tactic to the notes, but with more urgency. I’ll have my love alive soon enough!
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 61: I can’t do it. I can’t do it. The moment I hear her, tears begin to flow and my voice begins to crack. Oh, my fated love, how naive you are of what is to come. How I wish I could keep you from it.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 84: It’s time to stop with the small things. I need to call her, it’s the only way.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 85: I barely made it through the conversation, but I did it. It wasn’t long enough to keep a full conversation, but with time, it will.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 102: It feels like old times again, talking with her. I feel that burning excitement in my heart as the time grows close when I will get to speak with her again, the brightening of my eyes, the blazing of my cheeks. She is everything, and I will have her back.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 127: It’s not enough… what if I can delay her? Keep her on the phone long enough to be late? It has to work.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 143: Sometimes I wonder if it will ever work. I thought one attempt would suffice, and then when that failed, I thought perhaps five, then twenty-five, fifty at the very most. Now I have no inkling of when this torture will end. But I will endure it still, I will bring her back.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 166: I didn’t make another attempt today, I just stayed in my time machine, watching her. I could always go back if I wanted, not attempt it again, but it would be a bleak would. I am going all in, no more despair, for there will be no escape for me. I am now stuck in a time loop until I can rescue her.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 197: If the days have kept counting and I had never left for this loop, it would be the anniversary of the day we met today. I wish such reminders could bring me solace.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 214: Our phone conversations are the only thing that brings me any joy anymore. I have started seeing the world in grey tones once more, just as it was after she met her tragic fate, no, not fate, it was not fate!
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 239: What cruel trick does the universe or divine or whatever is the fabric of the cosmos that makes me suffer so? I would gladly give my life if it meant bringing her back, I have already given much of it up to build a time device and go to save her. Why do my pleas go unanswered?
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 262: Perhaps it is fate.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log 298: Every new idea I had to save her brought me hope, but fewer ideas come now.
  

  
Time Traveler’s Log: 330: I look back through the pages of this lo
