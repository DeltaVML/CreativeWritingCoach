I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Why are you letting subject 14 call you mommy?" Dr Betel asked with a disapproving sniff.

Dr Andrews raised her eyebrows as she looked up from her session notes. "Are you an idiot, Larry?"

"That's *doctor* Betel to you."

A hint of a smile touched her face as her barb hit the mark. "Are you so incompetent that you haven't read up on what *just happened* at site 83 with Billy Patton?"

"Don't you mean subject 8?"

"No." Dr Andrews replied flatly.  "Everyone who called him that is dead."

"And," she continued, cutting off a reply, "the only one who survived was Sally Allston, the one who got removed from the project for being too close to him."

"Didn't she put a bullet in his head?"

"Yes, because she's a *professional.* They've since listened to reason and allowed us to treat them like the children they are."

Dr Betel found himself staring at air and cursed. He pulled out his phone and began dialling the administrators.

Dr. Andrews suppressed a touch of fear as she found herself in front of her charge. "Oh, Stevie, you know you're not supposed to blip people outside the white room."

Stevie looked up from his bed with remorse. "But Mister Betel was making you mad and scared."

"It's okay, Stevie, Mister Betel was just being a poopie head."

Stevie gave a laugh and seemed to settle down.  A dark glint came into his eye.

"Can I make him sorry?" He whispered

"No, sweetie." Dr  Andrews said with a momentary spike of fear. "You promised you wouldn't hurt anyone. Now go back to sleep."

She sat for a few minutes until Stevie was asleep, then got up and headed to her own quarters nearby.

*Larry,* she thought to herself, *this child is far stronger than Billy and would notice long before even I could pull the trigger.*

*Besides,* she continued quietly in her head, *the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world *
