I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My father told me to never give away my name. Your name gives you power, and to lose that is to become helpless. As a Fae, names have always taken his words to heart.
  

  
Until I met Rhys Aoife Thiago. 
  

  
I remember him smiling as he told me, my eyes with a blank expression as I tried to figure out how to spell it. I spelled it Rise Eefe Chego. I failed horribly.
  

  
He smiled as he read the name on the cup and took a picture of the name before thanking me for the coffee and leaving. I had never wanted to get a name more right than at that moment.
  

  
He returned every day, continually amused by my various misspellings of his beautiful name. Rice Aiefe Cheagu, Ryz Yfe Ciago, Ryse Aeofe Chiaju. His response to each was always a smile as he carefully took a picture of the name.
  

  
One day I asked him why he always took a picture of the misspelling. He simply responded, “It amuses me. Did you know that I’ve seen over two hundred different spellings of my name over the years?”
  

  
My jaw dropped, was it going to take me over two hundred attempts to get his name right?
  

  
He chuckled at my stunned reaction, “Though out of all the spellings I’ve seen, yours are my favorite. Some of these even look better than my name’s real spelling.”
  

  
I utterly failed to hide my blush. I would find out the real spelling of his name, and the gorgeous smiling man gave me a multitude of chances to do so.
  

  
He came every day for his morning coffee. The time he came varied, but it was always during the hours of my shift. If there were multiple kiosks available, he always found his way to mine.
  

  
From his daily visits, I began to learn more about him. He had this adorable cat Saoirse. I made a bet with him that I could spell it, but I failed miserably. He smiled that wonderful smile and took a picture of each of my horrible attempts. He told me I was close, but he was just being nice (I looked up the real spelling later, I was way off).
  

  
I also learned that he was a translator. He spoke five different languages (I made him recite that sentence to me in all of them and each recitation was more beautiful than the last). He worked with so many different words and languages, yet a little misspelling of his name amused him so much. He baffled me in the best ways.
  

  
It had been over seventy days when I finally got his name right. I never confirmed it, but as I wrote the letters and they arranged themselves into the poetic Rhys Aoife Thiago, I knew I had found an arrangement as beautiful as him. Something stopped me before I handed the cup over. I could give it to him now, but then our game would end. Would he stop coming back if I no longer amused him with misspellings? No, I wanted to find all two hundred variations of his name, if only for two hundred lovely conversations with Rhys Aoife Thiago.
  

  
I added an accent over the e before handing the cup over. His eyes widened, thinking I had got it before he noticed the accent and sighed in relief. He looked at me and smiled, “I don’t think I ever learned your name.”
  

  
I answered without hesitation, “It’s Felloran.”
  

  
“A lovely name. Felloran, would you like to get together sometime?”
  

  
My heart did a flip, “I’d love to, coffee?”
  

  
He chuckled, “I doubt anyone else could spell my name as well as you. But I do know a restaurant where everything on the menu is utterly unpronounceable.”
  

  
I smiled, “Sounds wonderful.”
  

  
My father told me to never give away my name. Your name gives you power, and to lose that is to become helpless. But those who believe that have never been in love.
