I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Coming of age was meant to be exciting, joyous. At fourteen, we are given our purpose. Abilities unique to each one of us, granted by the collective intelligence.

My sister became able to sense the inner workings of any device she touched, and with this she wowed the academy of military mechanics. My cousin gained a perfect photographic memory, with which he excelled in school. Eventually his skills took him into the colonial forces, far away among the stars. 
My mother was given the humble gift of mending injuries, which she honed into a skill with surgery.

I still remember the moment I recieved my message, surrounded by my family, my heart pounding with excitement. I still remember the icy feeling that ran down my spine as I read its contents.

"Dont look at them"

The words burned themselves into my mind. The sensation spread to my eyes, fixed to the screen as I felt myself change.
I sat frozen, confused and afraid. My mother stood up from across the table, words of concern forming on her lips. The sudden movement in my field of vision caused my eyes to glance at her momentarily. I understood then.

In that moment I knew her completely. My eyes, without my control, tore into her. 

First her mind. Through my visual cortex swam every thought, every memory. I felt her love as she held me for the first time. I felt her joy and pride as she first used her gift to mend the wing of an injured bird. I felt her concern at my expression while reading my message, and felt that concern twist into primal fear when my eyes met hers.

Then, her body. The web of her being was laid bare, every firing neuron, every twitch of muscle. Her structure down to the molecules became as clear and understandable to my eyes as words on a page. All was to be observed, understood, and deconstructed. My vision tore through her form cell by cell.

It all happened in an instant. I threw my hands over my eyes, desperately trying to avert my mistake, as a wave of heat washed over me from the spot where my mother had stood, seconds ago.

My head buried in my hands, in darkness. 
My mind racing, breaking apart at the seams. I stayed in that darkness. As hours passed.
As the agents of the collective led me away so the cleanup crew could work. As they questioned me, their voices filled with awe and barely contained excitement. As I was examined, prodded and needled, shaped and molded.

When I finally saw the light, my purpose was clear. I saw the wars I would win for them. I saw the planets that would fall. When my eyes opened again, I beheld the face of the colonial rebel and smiled. I felt his fear. I felt every treason, real or imagined. Every errant thought against the collective. I understood.

My smile widened, and heat washed over me.
