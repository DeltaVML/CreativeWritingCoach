STORY:
================================

This one's gonna be short and outta pocket. Buckle up ðŸ¤£

---

The screams bounced off the walls of the house. Todd couldn't take it anymore. What had he done??

One minute Darlene told him everything would be okay. Then he felt his arms sink into her torso. The... The taste of cake batter and icing from her shirt. And then how she fell in half at the waist. And hit the floor as a well crafted piece of lifesize cake.

He'd tried his best to put her back together. But each piece he tried to put back together simply crumbled, the cake, so moist, so tender, simply crumbling more as he carried on. She no longer looked like the woman he loved. She looked like cake.

Todd sat catatonic as he dialed 911, the phone unresponsive.

"I'm gonna..." he stammered at Darlene's batter, "I can fix this. I can get help. Don't die on me."

The phone still wouldn't work, the call wouldn't go through. He pleaded, hollered. Why wouldn't it work? And then, he felt the sticky texture as he pulled it from his ear. The icing of the screen holding a distinct wrinkle from the edge of his ear.

And then, a new fear arose. One he hadn't thought about immediately. But if Darlene was cake...

"That means..." Todd sweated. "That means..."

He ran for the kids' room. Cake that used to be his phone smearing in his hands. He hit the fridge with his arm, a distinct gouge the size of a dinner plate wetly hitting the floor after falling off the front of it. The railing of the staircase squished under hand as his legs began to sink into the structure of the house. By the time he reached the top, he was ankle deep in the delicacy that was his own home.

"Kids?" He asked as he approached the top of the stairs.

There they sat in their room, unmoving. They seemed fine. Until he swam into their room and reached an arm out. Only to pull back with even more cake. A sallow vanilla flavor that broke him mentally in ways he couldn't understand.

He had to leave. Escape this place. But now he couldn't feel his legs. He couldn't feel his legs.

Because they were now crumbles of red velvet he'd dragged up the stairs and left behind in big red and white chunks.

Todd opened his mouth to scream and could only expel sugar. Icing. Filling. When the fondant that was his jaw finally fell loose from its unsteady perch, he was finally no more.

Unbeknownst to him, this happened everywhere, all at once. Thus the cakepocalypse had begun.
