STORY:
================================



The Casita tree has been steadily growing for some two thousand years, lovingly tended to by the Madrigals, that magical race with the deft penchant for tax evasion. Having reached a height of three hundred metres as of 2089, the tree towers over nearby farmlands and holds the height record among all flora by a considerable margin.

More unique to the Casita is the naturally occurring tunnel network that coils around the trunk with numerous entry points that the Madrigal population uses as their primary place of residence. A census conducted in 2080 revealed that the tree was home to numbers in excess of 4,000. 

Interestingly, Madrigal cuisine is centred around the Giant Fawn Bug, the Casita's one and only parasite, and so speculation that the tunnel evolved as an invitation for a symbiosis with the Madrigals has gained notable credibility in the natural sciences. 

For reasons unknown to anyone, most Madrigals are either 5th or 6th cousins of each other. Dating apps were thus outlawed in 2075 following two generations of "accidental fringe incest", in which the risk of subsequent child deformations was relatively low, but that of psychic turmoil remained high enough to place an untold burden on the Madrigalian mental healthcare system.

Since then, tensions have only worsened, sexual tension becoming rife throughout the entire community, the wellspring from which much political unrest and rivalling  hostility emerged to eventually destabilise their economy. 

Being subject to the governance and taxation code of Equatorial Guinea -- where the Casita is located -- to avoid bankruptcy pursuant to the crash, the Madrigals developed a formidable proficiency with tax evasion, less than $20US having been paid the past decade. Nearly half the population have since acquired a masters in taxation law, all of whom are employed by the council's treasury department.

These tax lawyers eventually coalesced into well-organised social networks outside the legal profession, and by 2085 they would branch off into their own political district. Hostility with fawn bug farmers, who account for a matching 45% of the populace, rapidly grew from 2086. 

Today, communication between each side is strictly limited to the render of necessary services. The lawyers to provide the farmers legal council, the farmers to provide the lawyers their food. Interactions of a divergent nature to either of these scenarios, with the exception of sporting activities, are punishable by death.

In spite their reliance on one another, still the struggle for dominance has proven to be highly persistent. Games of marbles on quarterly sports days have thus become heated to levels that have ended up fatal. More than forty deaths in 2088 alone, which was a 7% increase on the year previous. 

The annual Encanto festival is the one calendar destination where arms are lowered for the sake of tradition. It's also the only daytime rendezvous point available to Debbie and Dave, two highschool sweethearts who were separated by the divide. The vast vocational distance between fawn bug farming and tax law was too great for either to realistically consider a change of career, and by laws that couldn't be circumvented, they would be forced to work in their most suited roles anyway.

The barrier walls erected between the East tunnel and the West tunnel were tirelessly patrolled by the Madrigal military on both sides -- the last remaining cooperation between them.

Debbie, however, had other plans. Raised as a warrior nun before going to law school, she knew well the methods of hypnosis that could be weaponised against authority figures; and by his own hand, Dave knew how to dig holes.

After six months of planning and careful preparation, the under-passage was complete, and Debbie had over a hundred patrolman hypnotised in a perpetual state of orgasm -- which particular method had shown to have the most efficacy. Guards did their best to hide their physical euphoria in daylight hours, however, while independently on-duty at night, invariably they would each of them retire to one of many hiding spots to indulge in themselves, and frequently each other. Guards marrying other guards subsequently became a cause for necessary social reform to the benefit of the LGBT community.

Debbie and Dave met each other six midnights a week, their contact averaging four hours each, sleep deprivation held barely at bay by a succession of powernaps through the day. Hands held, they would walk to the wooden outcrop of the outdoor opening and sit and talk, and hold each other, faces lightless but for the filtered moonlight.  

Whether they were 5th or 6th cousins mattered to neither. All that mattered was their voices, and touch; their two hearts in that nightly twilight dance, away from it all, looking out across those blue valleys, together. Forever, until forever ended, the graffitied wall come down, sat in their home, twins on the way, a boy and a girl, neither to be farmer, or tax
