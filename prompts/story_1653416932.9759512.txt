STORY:
================================

#the life of a brother

*Step by step guide when your little sister is an angel of a witch:*

1) Do not under any circumstances insult her. She will turn you into a frog.(Note the use of angel in the title)

2) Do not let your sister out of sight in the middle of a hike through the forest. (Mother will ground you for letting your sister befriend another wild animal. The pack of wolves last month was enough)

3) Make sure your sister never cries and always prevent that from.(Important rule. Crying sisters and magic are not good mix)

4) If you're somehow unable to prevent her tears, make sure you're far, far away from the blast zone. (Your eyebrows will appreciate it.)

5) Your little sister will always steal the last cookie but you will never prove it.(Get used to this.)

6) Your sister is always right, be it weather patterns, or simple bets on a game.(Yout clothes will appreciate it when you heed her warnings. She's more accurate than the weather channel)

7) If you think your sister is a damsel in distress who needs to be protected, you couldn't be more wrong. She will curse every being who tries to hurt her and her curses are never pretty. (Let her fight her own battles or she'll fight all of yours turning you into the damsel in distress who she needs to rescue.)

8) In an argument in the family, make sure you always side with your sister or bribe her to join yours. (She always gets her way, don't ask how. Just appreciate it.)

9) Your sister is remarkably kind and will use her powers to help you and everyone else. (Make sure to reward her with head pats.)

10) Above all else, she's still your little sister, powerful Magic or not. If someone plots against her, make sure those people cease to exist.(It is after all the duty of a big brother to protect their sisters.)
