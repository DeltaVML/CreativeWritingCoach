STORY:

The bell rings, and I jolt awake.  Damnnable caffeine tolerance getting the better of me again, I think.  I suppose I'll just have to mutate a monster put that energy drink company to shame.  I look, and see a casually dressed young woman walk up.  "AH, HELLO, AND WELCOME TO PROFESSOR CARABUS' MENAGERIE OF MAYHEM AND BIOLOGY STUDY GROUPS!!"  I cackle maniacally, and she smiles at me.

"Professor Carabus, I've been told you've got a litter of the cutest little two headed kittens."  She says, and I sigh.

"Are you sure you can handle the needs of my dreaded Mayhem Panthers?"  I ask.  "You know they only take the finest in canned foods with gravy, fish flavored treats, and catnip."  I say as I walk from behind the desk and lead her to a small display of kittens.  They are, of course, dicephalic, but also napping in a cuddle puddle of societally disruptive proportions.  It is all I can do to resist picking one of them up and playing with their little peets during store hours.  She smiles and a long furred one, its feline donor an adorable ragdoll I adopted several years ago from a family that was moving across the country, walks up to her, taking the precarious wobbling steps of a freshly born kitten.

"Yes, Professor.  I even have a nice, fireproof cat tower and all the sparkly sequin toys for her to play with."  It reaches the glass and lifts itself up onto its rear paws and mewls at us.  She gets down and puts her fingertips to the glass, and it paws at her fingertips like it's boxing her.

"Hmm..."  I open the glass enough for it to push through and she picks it up carefully, and it purrs.  "Looks like someone made a new friend."  I say and she smiles.  The mutant, of course, just curls up in her grip, and purrs some more.  "Is that one the one you want?"  I ask, and she nods.

"Yes, Professor."  She says, and I escort her to the counter and pull out a tablet so she can fill out the paperwork with one hand while she carries her precious little monster.  She fills out the paperwork, and once it's done, my register dings.

"Okay, adoption fee is...  29.99, but because it's National Adopt A Cat day, I'll give you a fifteen percent discount, for a total of 25.49."  She pays with her Google Pay, and I smile, giving her a small metal ring.  "And I'll throw in a control harness!  Good for repelling fleas, ticks, and other vermin that would harm your kitten AS WELL AS giving it signals when you're leading it on a rampage through the city."  She smiles as she puts it on the kitten, as bands of synthetic leather wrap comfortably around its barrel and forelegs.

"Who's a sleepy baby princess?"  She coos at the kitten, now sleeping and purring in her arm, and I press a button to open the door as she approaches it.  After she leaves, I smile.

"Well, there's my good deed for the day.  Now to spin up my Gyroacceleration Cannon and spin a troublesome little rival away!"  I cackle maniacally as I flip the door sign to closed, and go into the back.
