STORY:
================================

“It’s finally happening!” squealed Lucy.
  

  
Jacques blinked, “Um.. we’d just like to file one of those relationship reports.”
  

  
Lucy grinned, “Mhm! We’ve been waiting for you two to hook up for a while!”
  

  
Jane raised an eyebrow, “Seriously?”
  

  
Jacques sighed, “I should have known.”
  

  
Jane turned to him, “What do you mean?”
  

  
Jacques smirked, “Don’t you remember three of our last five assignments?”
  

  
“I remember all our assignments with perfect memory, you know that.”
  

  
“Then you’ll remember they had as play couples for many of them.”
  

  
Lucy giggled, “You made such a cute family!”
  

  
Jane shook her head, “I still don’t approve of Seamus playing our child.”
  

  
Jacques nodded, “I know he’s a talented spy, but he’s twelve years old! He shouldn’t be out in the field!”
  

  
Lucy smiled, “Oh look at you two! Your parental instincts already kicking in! And Seamus is fine, it was a low-risk mission, we’ve sent him on worse.”
  

  
Jane gasped, “Worse?”
  

  
Jacques crossed his arms, “It was Project Omega, wasn’t it?”
  

  
Jane’s eyes widened, “They sent a child to defuse a bomb?”
  

  
Jacques rubbed his temples, “I get they needed someone with small hands but that was just too far.”
  

  
“Does he even have parents?”
  

  
“Probably not, it's why he’s willing to do anything for the agency, they’re basically his parents.”
  

  
“Poor thing, perhaps we should help take care of the guy. Give him the caring environment he deserves.”
  

  
Jacques groaned from Lucy’s amused awww, he leaned in close to whisper to Jane, “I agree, the kid needs a home. But let’s not give Lucy any more reason to put the three of us on a mission together.”
  

  
Jane nodded, “So the family was the first couples assignment. Then there were the teenage sweethearts…”
  

  
“You looked great in that uniform, honey. You’re even prettier than you were in high school from the photos you showed me.”
  

  
Jane blushed, “T-Thanks. Though I was rather awkward in high school. If I met someone as handsome as you then I’d probably trip over my words.”
  

  
The two gazed into one another’s eyes, though their intimate moment was quickly ruined by Lucy staring and awwing at both of them. Jacques coughed awkwardly, “And um.. the third couple costume was a step too far.”
  

  
“What was that one again?”
  

  
Jacques reddened, “Newlyweds.”
  

  
“Oh, right. That was a beautiful dress, too bad I got blood all over it.”
  

  
“It was a beautiful dress…” Jacques smiled, zoning out for a moment, “but um… we should probably get on with filling out the couples form.”
  

  
Lucy nodded, “The form will only take a few minutes, it's just a few basic questions. While you’re here, would you like to fill out an adoption form for Seamus as well?”
  

  
“Lucy!” the couple said in unison, rolling their eyes.
