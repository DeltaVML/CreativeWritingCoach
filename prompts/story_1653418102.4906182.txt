STORY:
================================

*"Welcome,"* the car speaker intoned as the vehicle rolled through massive wooden gates, *"to Human Park.‚Äù*

From the front passenger seat, Lord Alleric scoffed, "'Human Park'? A bit on the nose, aren't we, doctor?"

The vampire in the driver's seat, Dr. Vlad Blaughson, flinched. He had a healthy amount of fear for his boss, and rightfully so, Lord Alleric‚Äôs dominion covered a quarter of the planet.

"Names are trivial to change, if needed, my Lord," he finally replied. "But the park itself is what we should be focused on! The world's first human reserve, allowed to live and roam free in their natural habitats."

Stretched out before them was indeed a snapshot of humanity. A city in the distance, towns and suburbs surrounding, giving way to natural forests and mountains. The mountain tops were dotted by cottages and cabins, suitable for those humans who preferred a more 'rustic' lifestyle.

"How many residents?" Alleric asked as the car wound down the road toward the city.

"About 20,000 in this trial period, your lordship. But- but we can scale up quite quickly!"

"Number of infected among the 20,000?"

Vlad grinned, his fangs glinting in the sunlight. "Zero."

"None...?"Allerics eyebrows darted upward in surprise. "How many... abominations have *attempted* infection?"

Alleric avoided the term 'zombies' when he could, so great was his disdain for the 'walking dead'. Unthinking, uncivilized brutes, the lot of them. Killing and turning humans with no regard for the future. Vampires were all about sustainable farming of human resources, namely their precious blood.

Zombie blood, Alleric had learned the hard way, tasted of lead and sulfur, entirely useless as sustenance for the good, hardworking vampire citizenry of the world.

"No zombie has *ever* been detected on the island, Lord Alleric." Vlad beamed with pride. "We've been extremely careful with our transports to and from the mainland. Boats are swept bow to stern and all planes are carefully examined for stowaways, even in the wheel wells and other nooks and crannies."

"Impressive," the vampire lord muttered.

"What's impressive is your generous funding, my Lord. This reserve has given humans a chance to live free of the constant threat of being eviscerated by zombies." Vlad gestured to free range humans cheerfully working on their lawns as they drove by. "They're happy here. Free of fear. It's a great thing you've done for humanity, Lord Alleric."

"Mmm? Oh, yes, of course." Alleric ran his tongue along his fangs, salivating at the sight of all the healthy, organic humans they drove past. "And we can come here to feed on fresh, delicious, untainted human blood whenever we please... Making future plans for storage and export of the most precious liquid resource."

Vlad grimaced. "And that, of course, my Lord." He turned cheery once more. "But I believe there will be far greater unseen benefits to society than we can even‚Äî"

He was cut short by a blaring alarm.

"What the devil is that, doctor?" Alleric asked.

"That's, uhh‚Äî*shit,"* Vlad concluded as a zombie sprinted in front of the car, leaping onto the back of the nearest human and tearing into its neck.

Vlad scanned the surroundings until his eyes came to rest on the beach to their left. There, dozens of zombies clawed their way up onto the sand, hundreds more bobbed in the water behind them, slowly riding the waves in. 

With a sigh, Vlad powered up his tablet and ticked the 'Failure' checkbox next to 'Human Park: Experiment 1'.

"The zombies learned to swim," Lord Alleric stated plainly.

"The zombies learned to swim," Vlad echoed, nodding. "I‚Äî Forgive me, my lord. I should have forseen this possibility."

Alleric stared back at him, clearly more interested in solutions than apologies.

"I'll, um..." Vlad sputtered. "I'll begin researching options for walls, fencing, and moats filled with alligators at once."
