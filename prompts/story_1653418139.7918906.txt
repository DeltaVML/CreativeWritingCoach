Catacombs Of Amazon
  

  
	"Whew!"
  
	"That was a close one." She muttered to herself, after taking a step back, avoiding the container that came down on the location she was previously at. 
  
	Righting herself, she proceeds to check herself. While she moved, she felt as if she had almost released her bladder all over herself. Feeling that she hadn't, she still felt the powerful urge pee, but her break hasn't come; and her shift doesn't end, for many more hours. Looking at the container, she stepped forward, reached out, grabbed it, and proceeded to lift it up onto the cart. The container was heavy, and the cart didn't have a mechanism to lift heavy objects. The part of the warehouse she was in, was an older part of the warehouse, and it didn't have the electron magnets in the floor that enabled the new carts to levitate. Those new carts also had a small crane on board that assisted with the lifting of heavy objects. It puzzled her as why anyone would order something from this part of the warehouse. All the items here were either discontinued, return items, or items that couldn't cut it in the market; but who was she to judge, her job was just to pick up the item, for delivery. 
  
	"What is your status?"
  
	"Did you find the item?"
  
	The sound of the radio going off, scared her, and she almost peed herself a second time.
  
	"Yes! I found it. But it was on an aisle, two aisle's away from where it was supposed to be." 
  
	"Good" replied her supervisor.
  
	"Get it back as soon as you can. No rush."
  
	No rush? What did he mean by that. We are always in a rush. If an item is late, it goes on your record, and the overall percentage of the team drops. The means, no bonuses, no time off, no promotion, or worse, demotion to working the lines. I worked hard to be fetcher, I won't let this stupid item ruin my score!
  
	"What do you mean, 'no rush'?" She replied to her supervisor.
  
	Her heart was racing. Her supervisor hadn't replied in a quick, and expedient manner. Her rapid pulse could cause her to pee. 
  
	"I mean, no rush." Replied her supervisor, interrupted her out of control train of thought. 
  
	"The warehouse manager ordered the train to leave early, and take all the orders in the loading bay. Something about a storm coming, and some elite member moving their delivery date up. You know how those elite people are."
  
	"Yeah. I know." 
  
	"Hey, can I take my bathroom break early? I am about to pee my pants." Hoping her request worked. 
  
	"Yeah, go ahead. Then make your way back after you are done."
  
	"Thanks! See you when I get back."
  
	Breathing a sigh of relief, she looked down at her map of this part of the warehouse looking, for either a bathroom or a secluded place, that she can safely pee at. Even though she hasn't run into anyone, since she entered this part of the warehouse, she was always on the lookout, for peepers; and or below market nomads, who wonder the aisles, and sometimes live in the older parts of the warehouse. 
  
	After consulting her map, she finds that the nearest bathroom is over fifty aisles way from her, and she will surely pee her pants attempting to make it there. At the end of aisle she was currently in, was a small space labeled, 'Broom Closet', whatever that is, inside a support column. This space would provide her with the needed privacy, so she could safely empty her bladder. 
  
	After reaching the end of the aisle, she approaches the door. This, 'Broom Closet' hasn't been used in a very long time, judging by the door, and the faded sign on the door. She opens the door, makes her way in. She closes the door behind her, turns on the single light in the room. The light illuminates an absolutely filthy room. She others wise wouldn't choose a room like this to pee in, but her need to pee is stronger than her disgust, for the state of the room. She quickly unclips her radio, grabs the tablet that contains the map, set both of them on the floor in front of her, as she lowers her pants, and squats over the container she will pee into. 
  
	As she is enjoying the wonderful feeling of her bladder releasing it's contents, she looks ahead of her. As she is looking ahead, she tilts her head to the right, looking at these weird objects to the right of her. They are long sticks, with what appears to be a bad hair job at on end. As she looks at it further, she sees what looks like sticker pealing at the corners, but this sticker looks like it wraps around the stick multiple times.
  
	After she finishes peeing, she seals the piss bottle, pulls her pants back up, picks up her radio, and tablet; and clips them back onto her utility belt. Before she leaves the room, she takes a moment to peel back some of the sticker, only to find that the adhesive only adhered to one side. After she pulled, the whole wrapping came loose, off of the stick. Looking at the writing on the wrapping, she was surprised to see a map of warehouse, with a marked out path, leading to a destinatio
