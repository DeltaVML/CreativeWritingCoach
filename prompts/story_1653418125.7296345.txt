I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

It has been over 40 years since symptoms first manifested. *They* have been unrelenting in their purge. I have lost friends, families, loved ones, but still I carried on with my work. It is the only thing I have left now.

It was by pure chance that I discovered *them*, their existence floated to the surface in a sea of equations too turbulent to explain in words. Priests and clergymen speak of intelligent design, incorrectly pointing to flawed evidence of a greater being, but ignorantly blind to the real proof hiding in the mathematics of the physical laws all around us. Only an intelligent mind with concrete goals could design a system so flawlessly interlinked.

No one would believe me. The general populace wouldn't even be able to understand what I was trying to explain. I had to expand the understanding of the human race before I could begin to free us from the shackles binding our free will. I needed power, respect, and recognition on the topic, so I set out to became a professor.

*They* noticed fairly quickly, and I was diagnosed with a neurological motor disfunction, but I knew the true identity of my ailment. *They* couldn't kill me outright, it would disrupt the Probability of the system. No, they had to make my death likely, believable, and acceptable. And I was slowly losing the ability to continue my work, it was a terrifically efficient method of killing two birds with one stone.

Fortunately, I had time before the full extent of my curse manifested. I spent the first year building a robot servant that I named Jane. She has since become a vital part of my journey into the unknown. I cannot count the number of times she has saved my life. Even now, she is writing this passage for me as I dictate it. I fear I may lose all motor function before I finish. 

I am sorry, I have failed. I was not able to untie the knots of our prison. Sometimes I felt I almost succeeded, but the quantum wave fluctuations would collapse and I would be brought back to square 1. The line between success and failure is often an unsurmountable wall despite its paper thin thickness. 

I alone am not enough, I don't have much time left. There is only one way to save ourselves: I need to gather those capable of carrying the burden of my work, from across all time and space.

Let this memoir be a record of my journey and struggle. My name is Stephen William Hawking and this is my story.
