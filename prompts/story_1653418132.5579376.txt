STORY:

I looked out upon the city that had eaten me up and spit me out. I tried to think of the good people in my life. The memories that had helped me through the tough times. Even just the good times. Nothing came. Well, just one thing. A dog I had when I was growing up. She was the only loyal thing I had ever known. The only thing that I had loved or had shown me any love. But that was 15 years ago. Maybe I’ll get to see her when this is over. Maybe. 

I take one last breath. I whisper, “fuck it.” Then I fall forward. I see the buildings in the skyline fall up as many turns into one. The one across the street. I think I see a glimpse of myself in the windows that begin to rush by, but I can’t be sure. Then I see the street below and then white noise. The wind is so loud I can’t even hear my screams. If I was screaming. The cars get bigger. I can see more detail on people’s clothes. I see a hot dog vendor drop something, pick it up, and put it back on his cart. “Gross” I think. Then I close my eyes. I feel a pain that can only be described as being hit by a truck. The pain is like nothing I have ever felt. It felt like I was folded in a lawn chair then squeezed in a vice. But only for a split second. Then blackness.

I heard voices. Worried voices. Gasps. Then I heard movement. Feet shuffling. Horns. I smelled something. Hot dogs. And the faint scent of garbage. My eyes start to twitch and light starts to poke through. I open them, or rather, one since I seemed to be on my stomach with my face on pavement. I groan as I push myself up of the street. I stand and look at the crowd that is looking at me. I look up at the building that I had chosen as my last vantage point. I look back towards the source of the hot dog odor.  “Well...fuck!”
