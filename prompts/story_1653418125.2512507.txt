I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:

Okay, I didn’t *mean* for it to happen. I won the lottery. My family and I are well off and have no real need for a billion dollar. Plus, my partner and I are trying for a baby. We assumed the enhancement would pass down to them. We stopped trying pretty soon after the enhancement. I mean, what kind of evolutionary enhancement is an extra set of arms? Sure I could do things twice as fast and hold twice as many things. But the arms weren’t exactly…the right age. It was dumb of me to assume a genetic enhancement would automatically match my body’s current age and physical strength. So now, here I am. Stuck with an extra pair of arms that have the mobility and strength of toddlers’s arms.
