STORY:

I know I shouldn’t, but I can’t help it. Class is just so boring, and I can only stare out the window for so long.
  
And she has the most exciting thoughts of anyone in the class.
  
At first, I thought she could tell I was reading her thoughts. Why else would her daydream end whenever I showed up?
  
But after encountering the same scene playing out in her head the second day in a row, with Mr. Darcy droning on about a comparison between Othello and modern cinema, I suddenly wondered if perhaps she’d had that thought stuck in her head on her own.
  
And if so, why?
  
I followed her after class, shoving past my classmates as I caught up.
  
“Hey!” I said when I was behind her.
  
She didn’t respond. I didn’t need to read her thoughts to know she was lost in her own world.
  
“Rachel,” I said, saying her name as if it was a question. We hadn’t talked before even though we were in the same literature class.
  
Rachel turned around, questioning me with her eyes. 
  
“John,” I say, introducing myself.
  
She nods, waiting.
  
“Did you understand what Mr. Darcy was going on about today?”
  
Rachel turns and walks away, slow enough that I recognize it as an invitation to follow.
  
“I don’t really pay attention,” she admits. 
  
I already know. “Oh?” I say, hoping she continues.
  
“I’ll study for the test,” she says as if it’s the simplest thing in the world.
  
I’d kill for her confidence.
  
We take a few steps before she continues. “I’m a writer. Most of the time, I’m thinking about scenes for my story.”
  
It suddenly all clicks. The recurring scene, the abrupt ending: she has no idea where to go next.
  
Well, I’ve watched a lot of movies. Plus, after reading so many people’s thoughts, I have a pretty good idea of what people expect.
  
But I can’t just outright tell her what should come next.
  
We continue our conversation all the way to our cars, me on autopilot while trying to figure out a way to help her with her story. She’d know my mind was somewhere else if she could read thoughts too.
  

  
*The female warrior stands outside the castle gates with her horde at her back. The king allows for an audience, saying only one person can come inside.*
  
*The warrior steps forward without a second thought and is stopped by her second in command. He proclaims his love for her and begs she let him go in her place.*
  
*“The king won’t respect you,” he says, pleading with her.*
  
*“He has no choice,” the female warrior says.* 
  

  
We’ve been here before. Next, the female warrior will walk through the gate and be led up the castle stairs to the king’s throne. And that’s where it ends, every time.
  
Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is going on about the role of women in Othello. From what I understand, they don’t have vital roles in the play and are only there to further the plot.
  
I lean over to Rachel, having taken the desk next to hers, and ask if she will study for the test, implying that she isn’t paying attention.
  
Rachel shakes her head, coming out of her daydream, and nods.
  
“I’d kill for your confidence,” I say. Then, before Rachel can respond, I add, “I can see the dude in charge saying something like that, nodding toward Mr. Darcy.
  
We both know I’m not talking about Othello, but there’s no way she can prove it.
  

  
*The female warrior walks into the throne room. The king looks down on her, all fury and bluster, and demands she explains.*
  
*Standing in shining silver armor, his primary knight commands her to kneel.* 
  
*The female warrior, wearing furs that leave her arms bare and exposing numerous cuts and bruises, shakes her head.*
  

  
And here we go. This is where her daydream ends every time. Rachel doesn’t want the warrior dead but can’t ever find a way out of the room. This time…
  

  
*The king laughs. It’s a booming laugh that echoes off of the throne room walls. Every knight in the room looks at the king, then at each other, before they permit themselves a chuckle.* 
  
*“I respect your confidence, girl,” the king says. “I’ve killed men for less.” He laughs once more, shaking his head. “Where’d you get it?” the king asks.*
  
*“Get what?” the warrior said.*
  
*“Your confidence! Was it your dad? A lover or a husband?”*
  
*The female warrior stared at the king’s primary knight. “I killed for it,” she says with a sly smile and a wink.*
  

  
I stop reading her thoughts right as Mr. Darcy announces the date and time for the test. “Plenty of time to study,” I say to Rachel as we leave class.
  
“I’ll walk out of there with exactly what I want,” she replies.
