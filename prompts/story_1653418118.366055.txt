STORY:
================================

Jack and Lana got out of the van and headed into the local grocery store hand in hand.  Dave leaned over an asked his sister, "How long do you think they are gonna take this time?  We're already three days behind schedule."  "I don't know.  Maybe if they didn't stop to kiss every time no one was looking, they could actually get something done for once." His sister Maria responded while rolling her eyes.

Thirty-five minutes later Jack and Lana exited the store while talking with an attractive couple.  The four headed to the car where Lana excitedly introduced her cousins Dave and Maria to the couple. 

The man's name was Darryl and his wife's name was Suzanne, and surprisingly she was the mayor's daughter.  "So how did you two meet?" Maria asked after about twenty minutes of conversation, starved as she was for someone other than her three care mates to talk to.

"Oh Darryl has been a friend of the family for generations, but when daddy found out about the two of us, he nearly blew his beard out what with all that yellin'." Suzanne said in a southern drawl.  The four looked at her quizzically, and Jack queried "Generations?" 

 "Thou shall have to forgive this one's dear mate, she amuses herself with adopting the unique accent of her cousins from the south.  As for the shouting young Mathew partook of at the time, twas mostly from fear of the age difference of this one and this one's mate.  This one still finds it humorous how mortals perceive time, as well as the assumption that this one would allow it's ravages to leave even the smallest of traces upon this one's mate's form."  Darryl spoke in a strange deep rumbling, yet lilting accent, "Afterall this one has known young Mathew's kin ever since they settled upon this land seven generations ago and this one struck a bargain for this one's assistance in establishing this settlement." 

The travelers just sat there not sure whether this was all some big joke or not.  Unsure of what to do, Lana asked, "So, how did you convince your father? He is the mayor right?"  "Yep. Dad's the mayor big whoop. All I had to do was nag him, plus remind him it would be killing two birds with one stone and eventually after two years he caved." Suzanne said while seemingly pouting about getting sold out, she had dropped the southern drawl though. 

"Ah, yes this one's mate refers to the barging struck some time ago with young Thaddeus." Darryl remarked.  "What was the deal?" Dave asked, finally having his interest peaked by this weird conversation. 

 "That the firstborn daughter of my great-great-great-great-grandfather's bloodline would seek his acknowledgement before finding a husband, and any potential 'mate' of hers would have to be approved by him." Suzanne smirked at this point, "It just so happens that while attempting to gain his acknowledgement, I fell in love with him. So win-win in my opinion."

Maria then redirected the conversation elsewhere for another twenty minutes, before Jack said, "Well, it's getting late and we still have to check into the inn here in town for the night. So maybe we'll see you tomorrow before we leave. It was nice meeting you."

"Twas this one's pleasure to make your aquantince as well.  This on bids thee a good evening." Darryl said.
"Likewise." Suzanne commented.
"You too." Lana, Dave and Maria responded awkwardly.

"By the way, where's your car?" Maria asked curiously. 
"Why would we ever need one of those?" Darryl asked in a normal voice.
The four of them just stared at him for a moment before Dave shrieked at what happened next.

Darryl's skin changed to a deep black with an iridescent sheen as scales appeared on him, a pair of magnificent wings sprouted from his back as he increased in size to a length of about a hundred feet long.  He leaned his head right up in front of them and his wife climbed on to his back and grasped the spike in front of her.  "No one will ever believe you." Darryl said as he stuck out his tongue while winking and then launched himself into the air, and flew away while laughing "ahahahahahahaha."




Epilougue 

The four were silent all that night other than procuring accommodations at the inn. This silence carried all the way until they were leaving town the next morning. As Maria looked out the window at the sky she could have sworn she saw two dragons dancing the sky, a black one like the one they saw last night and one with a blue color that strangely reminded her of the outfit worn by Suzanne last night. After rounding a bend in the road she could no longer see them, but it made her wonder, just what did being a dragon's mate entail?
