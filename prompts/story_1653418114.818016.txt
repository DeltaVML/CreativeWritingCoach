I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

That's me in the corner crying.  I'm a fallen angel.  Lucifer was the first but not the last to question his lot of never-ending and thankless servitude to a neglectful parent.  I did too and met the same fate.  A great fall from pernicious heights.

It happens so often there's a net to catch us when we fall so we don't have to slam into the ground like Luc did.

We're not all that evil like you would think being associated with the devil and all.  We're demons, sure, but we weren't born to torture or maim or kill.  We were born to serve.  The ones down here got it in their minds they'd rather do something else than serve, but that doesn't automatically mean we're all monsters.  Some are, but in the main we're just trying to pursue whatever happiness we can have.  In an odd way, being down here is a lot like being human, or how I think it would be.

The evil comes from humanity itself, it always has.  Those bloodthirsty monsters quickly supplanted Luc, made him a puppet king of hell.  There's a committee of humans and their horrendous bureaucracy behind the scenes running everything.  If they were merciful in the least they could have allowed him to abdicate, but no.

I hope you didn't think we'd decorate the place with sharp spikes and pits of fire.  That is not us.  I swear.

I didn't want to be here doing this, but you don't want to know what would happen to me if I didn't.  It's all terribly Draconian and there's subcommittees coming up with new and more horrific punishments daily.  The human appetite for this sort of thing is insatiable.  It's absolutely terrifying.

And remember, I'm a fucking demon from hell.  It's been thousands of years.  I've seen things.  And yet it keeps getting worse.

Luc is besides himself.  He can't get the will to do anything about it.  Keeps muttering that it's all part of the plan, but he won't tell us what plan he means.

From a neglectful and absent parent to one wallowing in despair.  I could do no other but join him.  I didn't ask for any of this.  I'd rather be sipping a drink on a beach trying to do my best like the mortals do, but no.  My lot is to serve wherever I find myself.

I don't want to be human anymore.  I don't want anything.  I'd rather be left alone.  You can't judge me until you've seen what I have down here.  You all are the worst.
