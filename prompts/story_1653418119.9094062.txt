STORY:
================================

"W-what?" the diplomat in the white robes replied, "Oh great one, I simply do not..."  The team of travelers were exchanging worried glances.  They had journeyed countless light years to trace the precursor signal back to the chamber in the middle of a mountain-sized comet circling a star in a derelict system devoid of planets.

"You most certainly do not," the hologram replied, "and that is the problem.  When you start doing, maybe you will.  Now, get out of my chamber before I teleport you into the star."

"You must hear me," the man spoke, "The Istillians are destroying our culture, our civilization, one planet at a time.  We seek the fabled technology of the great ones."

"I scanned your ship when it drew closer 10 years ago!  Your pathetic, groveling species deserves its fate based on your technology alone.  Lasers?"  the hologram chuckled, "Cryopods?  Your species cannot even travel faster than light?  Pathetic."

"Shut up!" a man with a rifle stepped forward.  He was clad from head to feet in body armor but even then the anger in his voice gave all present the picture of his hidden face twisted in rage.

"What is this?" the hologram hissed, "One of the apes has teeth?  Have you fallen from your tree and landed on your head one too many times?"

The man lifted the helmet from his head and spat.  The spittle flew through the hologram, of course, "Let's go.  We'll figure this out ourselves.  The only assholes were the precursors if this machine is any indication."

"Oh ho," the hologram stated, "Do what your head ape says.  Leave.  The precursors were miles above your pathetic species."

The man removed the pack from his back worldessly and pulled out something resembling a black rectangle.  Red lettering flashed across it's surface as he dropped it to the ground.

"My scans indicate that is nuclear," the hologram stated flatly while raising something that passed for eyebrows, "What are your intentions, apes?"

"Guess, asshole," the man with the rifle said, his face breaking into a smile.

"Forgive us, great one!" the diplomat said, pulling a key from his robes and inserting it into the box, turning it the device began counting down, "If we leave you here, there is a chance the Istillians will find you.  Even if our species dies, we cannot let the galaxy face them with that kind of technology."

"You will leave this here to destroy me while you run with your tails between your legs?" the holograms questioning gave way to anger again.

"We do not plan to leave," the diplomat said simply, "You have scanned our ship.  You know this was a one way trip for us."

"Very well," the hologram said and the black box disappeared, "We shall do this the hard wa..."

The sound of gunfire filled the hologram chamber as every single person in the room pulled out an assortment of pistols and rifles and opened fire at walls, panels, and everything else they could.  Their weapons were suddenly gone and in an instant they were pounding on surfaces with their fists.  Their attacks did nothing and they realized that stories of the precursors having energy shielding were true.

"Well well," the hologram said laughing, "You win.  You win.  It seems I misjudged you."

"It's a trick, he will teleport us to..." the man in body armor yelled.

"If I wanted to teleport, you would have been gone along with your crude bomb," the hologram stated, "To meet at last a race of diplomat-warriors!"

The group of men and women gasped as the walls of the chamber went transparent.  They seemed to be floating in the vastness of space despite feeling their feet planted firmly on the metal floor.  Suddenly dozens of holes appeared in space itself, through the holes dozens of planets hung.

"Istillian worlds," a woman spoke for the first time", pointing to one of them, "That is Istillia itself, see the shipyards and three moons?"  

One by one the worlds went white, appearing to foam, then exploding outward ripping through space stations, starships, and anything that was unfortunate enough to be in orbit.

"What... what just happened?" the diplomat asked.

"Core destablizers," the hologram answered, "I have removed your problem."

"Jesus," the man in armor whistled through his teeth, "Just like that?"

"Now, apes," All faces turned to the hologram, "You have much to discuss."

"Well, let's get started," the diplomat stated, approaching.

"Oh, not with me," the hologram stated as a hole appeared in the midst of the humans through which a golden world could be seen , "The precursors wish a word."

"But," the diplomat said, fear in his eyes, "I thought they were dead."

"They are not," the hologram stated as he bowed, "They just went... elsewhere.  This station is the gate and I am but the gatekeeper.  You have been found worthy, now go."  He motioned to the hole.

With that, the group stepped through.
