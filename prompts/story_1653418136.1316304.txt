STORY:
================================

Tuesday night and the starlight is a blanket laid upon us. In a few more hours the hillside will glisten with dew and the first of the cockerels will sing; they sing here, one of the thousand things I’ve struggled to get used to. Until Eliza, I thought that I was the only one struggling.

I can feel her in the grass beside me, just outside arm’s reach.

I’ve worked three weeks for just this moment, and now my mouth is dry and my hands are shaking, and she won’t look away from that blanket full of stars.

*“What can you do?”* they’d asked her. *“What’s your damage?”*

Three weeks, and I’ve never once heard Eliza answer. I wonder if it’s harder for the people who don’t wear it on their skin.

“Aren’t you going to ask me?” she asks, a hard edge to her voice. I glance over. A summer night, and she’s shivering too.

I shake my head, a few seconds pass before I realize she isn’t looking. “No. I just thought you might need to get out. Sometimes…well, I remember what it’s like to be new here.”

Below us, Belcarra University spreads across the valley like spilled ink, dark dormitories and dark classrooms, and the darkness out on Convocation Field where we’ll gather in the morning, exhausted and pretending that we hadn’t just seen each other. I’ll never understand how it is so many of them can sleep.

“I paint dreams,” Eliza says, and her voice is brittle now, cracking. “My dreams mostly, but sometimes other people’s. And sometimes dreams I haven’t had yet, but that I know will come, and will be so, so much worse off the canvas. How’s that for stupid magic?”

A light comes on in Belcarra. The Headmaster’s Office, I think, he often wakes in the night. Eliza might not know it yet, but he’s another Dreamer; you can see it in the bruises gouged beneath his eyes. I’ve always thought it’s comforting to see an adult struggle with it.

I roll onto my side and Eliza flinches. Her body is a rigid line, her dark clothing barely visible with just the starlight, our scrap of moon. I scoot back a little farther, always staying out of arm’s reach.

“It’s not stupid,” I say.

“Yeah?” she says. “Look.”

And Eliza paints a dream across the sky above us.

Three weeks she’s been at Belcarra University. Her pain, whatever it is, is fresh, and with fresh pain comes a certain madness that ages like fine wine into power. She paints with the starlight, a faint silver gathering at the tip of her finger, and the images that slide across the sky don’t make any sense to me at all. They can’t yet, and maybe they never will. They don’t have to, I’ll watch them anyway.

“Told you it’s stupid,” she says when it’s all over, voice toneless now, the edges all ground out.

I sit up slowly, grimacing at the stiffness in my bones, my skin. I look back down at Belcarra, Convocation Field. The practice ranges. The amphitheater cut out of the hills where the Screamers do their work.

Eliza’s waiting on an answer that I don’t have, to a question that she didn’t ask. I’ve been there too.

“You know,” I say, “sometimes I think that the aftermath is the worst of it. People don’t understand that, they just see the triumph that comes after that, the magic and the power, and they don’t know what it took to get there. Surviving, and then remembering every night that you survived. I think it’s convenient for them just to think about what we’ll be, and not what we are right now. If any of *that* makes sense.”

We’re quiet for a while longer. One of the cockerels starts its song too early and the others crow it down. I lay back upon the grass, the cool earth feels good against my skin. Yes, I think, it might be harder for the people who don’t wear it on their skin. People ask them *“What’s your damage?”* and then they have to figure out how to answer. How to put the worst experiences of their lives into words. Nobody ever needed to ask me.

“Frederick—” Eliza begins.

A cloud passes over the stars, our scrap of moon.

She gasps. I glance over and even the rigid line of her body has disappeared. Her breath comes quick and shallow, the sound filling up the world now that the cockerels have gone. I know that sound, the rush of panic. Everyone at Belcarra University knows that sound.

It’s the darkness.

“It’s alright,” I say, “it’s just a cloud. That’s all, a cloud.”

She breathes faster, shallower. Three weeks I’ve tried to talk to her, we came out on this hilltop to get some peace, to steal away from the teachers and the students, the claustrophobic dormitories, and I’ve of course stolen her on a nearly moonless night like the idiot I am.

“It’ll go soon,” I say, “don’t be scared.”

But of course, those words have never helped anybody.

A movement in the night. Perhaps. Perhaps I’d like to think it is. I think I saw her turning towards me. I think I saw her reaching out. For help? Of course.

I reach towards her, the stiff, empty air between us, her body just beyond arm’s reach. I should have known she wouldn’t reach out.

And the stubborn cloud won’t move. Eliza lies b
