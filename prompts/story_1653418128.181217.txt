I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Marvin was a genius, had to be, for he was the first man to ever turn the dark art of necromancy upon his fellow followers.  Wars had been fought, lost and revanchist movement generated all in the name of the one great necromancer yet no one thought to break the taboo and reraise our lost brethren.  Well he would be the one, and this great war would be the last.

His mentor, Jarvis, was the first he turned his strength upon.  It was more difficult than normal, his brain ripped more than normal and he could tell this soul wanted to be independent, but he achieved his task.  Now there were two, and he in command.  Thus he sent Jarvis to himself reanimate his master (and any fallen apprentices) before setting off to confront the white armies at the great castle.

As he set about the long march to the castle he slowly gained more and more followers.  With each his brain ripped more yet his power and ability to command grew.  However strong his power he could not help but engage the occasional floating thought.  But not all these thoughts were his.  

The ailing mother who only wanted for her lost child.  The commander who watched his company of men, whom he loved as sons, die at the hands of his enemy.  Even those enemies!  Oh they began to join in song as Marvin himself was more and more overcame with the reasoning and suffering of even past enemies and what drove them.

For all his fighting by the time he reached the castle, and saw the White Armies of his foe, he was overcome with a solemn bliss.  Did these, this great enemy, perceive him as did the now millions he commanded?  If so, surely they must be correct in this view?  He could not go on, his conscious could not let him continue even one more minute of the suffering millions.

Thus Marvin disbanded his army as immoral, having weakened himself completely in the process.  His former enemy was taken aback as he turned from them and walked away.  He had been enlightened, so when his former enemy struck him in the back with a great arrow: he knew the were correct.
