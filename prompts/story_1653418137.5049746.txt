I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“So what is your power?” The administrator says. Everyone has one all we know is they are made from our worst fear, once our worst fears are fully developed at around age 10 - 12.

“Well, I am not entirely sure. Sometimes things just happen. They tend to happen?” I say as to misdirect the conversation. For some context I have been at the center of many insane coincidental tragedies. Pretty much anyone who follows them knows my face. 

However there are a few things. One no matter how many people test to see if I am lying or in anyway when asked if I intended for the tragedy to happen. They run all the tests and note that they have nothing to get me with. 

When I leave I wave goodbye to the head chief. “See ya’ hopefully at a bar or diner or something. But we both know this will happen again. I don’t like it, but. It’s true. Can’t even keep me locked up, the boiler will blow breaking open the front door or something.” I don’t look back but I can feel it the chief is in a state almost laughing but you could tell. The melancholy in the air. 

Outside there was a swarm of reporters. There were few familiar faces, he’s done this a million times before.

They asked all of the questions “what exactly happened?”, “why do you think you are walking free?” “Are you aware how suspicious it is to survive these situations multiple times in a row?”

I answer all of the questions as I always do. As neutrally as possible.

That night when I get home I feel my heart racing. Tears swell in my eyes as the emotional toll hits me. At first I couldn’t hold it in once I learned what I had done I was inconsolable for days. But after the fourth or fifth time, I almost started getting used to it. Of course the first few times happened when I was really young and I had no way of knowing what activating my powers felt like. 

Today however, it’s different I onow the exact moment when I should confirm my surroundings to keep them their. If I had to count off of the top of my head then I’d say I’d stopped about 100 - 200 incidents. They almost happen in times right after my mental health jumps into the shitter as well. 

As I rub my eyes I stare into the darkness behind my eyelids. “Okay count from 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Ok, Now you know you are here, your heart is beating And you are thinking you don’t feel any pain. Next the door behind you is attached and so is the floor. By extension the walls and everything below you. And since the walls also suport every floor above you they are still there as well. Everything in your apartment is still here. You saw the windows, none of them were broken or opened. Now, the building is still here, the cars out side are still here, since I don’t hear any pandemonium, everything should be here. Now,”

“OPEN YOUR EYES” I yell that every time,  it always seems to help. It’s a good thing it can’t happen when I don’t notice my eyes ever close, because then waking up would be this whole ordeal. You probably want to know what I am afraid of and what it does. Well basically I have Optiohobia, the fear of opening your eyes. When I close them, I always get anxious that when I open them something important will just be gone. And when I do open them, everything
I don’t convince myself is truly there disappears like it never existed. I don’t know if they are turned into particles or simply erased or what. It’s why they could never get me, traces of my power on any object can’t exist because those objects would be gone.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
