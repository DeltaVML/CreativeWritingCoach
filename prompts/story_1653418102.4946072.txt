STORY:
================================

NRP - III or Nature's Reserved Park III

Klint slowly read as he prepares for his 88th Tour.

"Man, this NRP is one of the oldest isn't it? Like 30 Million Humans are living on it right now." Klint told to Hughes

"Yeah, but that was 2 years ago. Right now, almost a quarter of it exist as there was an outbreak. A zombie mutated thrice near the border and successfully destroyed its wall unleashing a massive amount of other double mutated zombies and normal zombies. All units were lost, even the high and mighty Night Vampires and Dark Werewolves special forces were wiped because of the sudden influx." Hughes replied back coldly to Klint.

"Yeah, that was the news. What really happened? Special forces have the power to one hit kill highly mutated zombies?" Klint replied.

"Humor is that this triple mutated zombie is a Wood Elf Zombie. Very nimble and very fast. Like pure speed monstrosity and this zombie is a survivor from the first Earth out break. I don't how did it survived that long and how they didn't found it right away."  Hughes explained as he tuck himself to their transportation.

"Man, so it is still there?" Klint asked with fear.

"Nay, they did managed to kill it but they paid a huge price. Remember General Fyr? He died battling that zombie. With other 3 Majors and 10 Lieutenants. All from Orcs Division." Hughes explained to Klint.

"So right now, Us, Twilight Vampires, are set to clean the remaining infected NRP and let the humans repopulate it again. Man, Those Ancient geezers are really up to something. I thought NRP - VI and VIII are already enough to supply us with a steady flow of blood and NRP - III will remain at is it?" Klint replied to Hughes.

"Listen, Klint, 3/4 of NRP is a lost cause. What we will do is clean up that 3/4 and burn the bodies of other Grimms that died deep on the breached wall. Anytime soon, those dead bodies will turn into Zombies. Remember the Night Vampires and Dark Werewolves special forces? Higher ups predicted that in 2 or 3 months they will turn into Zombies. If we let that happens, NRP-III will be history. Give more time, NRP - XX isn't far away, it could be the next ruin. I just don't know why they don't just bring out the cleaners." Hughes told Klint.

"Cleaners are busy with other important thing. Twilight Vampires are on par with Shadow Moon Werewolves which are Elites. Klint, you're already stronger than a General and Hughes you're an elite general. Now, gents, what you see below is the ruined part of NRP - III. Can you see our reconnaissance team over there? We will move from there to the breached wall. The bodies of Night Vampires and Dark Werewolves special forces aren't scattered vastly so we can burn them right away and start cleaning the rest afterwards." Polaxe told them.

While landing, there was an abrupt commotion happening at the outpost.

"Fuck, a zombie Night Vampire."
