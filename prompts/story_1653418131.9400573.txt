I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I misread this as a Fey having someone else have *their* name and thus incur a debt to them every time they say it.  In that case the most powerful fey would be celebrities... or the assholes who cause drama just to cause drama (especially political drama).

Star!Fey would take glamour to a whole new level.  Starstruck fans so obsessed with their idols they don't even realize what is being taken away or placed over their heads.  The producers and directors are in on it... some by choice for boons and wealth, while others are trapped in a web of debts and deceit.

Actually this would explain a lot about some children of stars'/celebrities/rich-and-famous names.  Moonunit anyone?  Petal Blossom Rainbow?  Exa Dark Sider√¶l?  Aleph?

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
