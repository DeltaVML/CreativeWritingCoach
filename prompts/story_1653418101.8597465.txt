I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My genetic divergence has been a pain in the ass, until now.
  

  
I have a very acute sense of smell. Out of all the senses to have an enhanced version of, smell has got to be the worst. I can smell body odor from across the street. I always know who dealt with it. There is no escape from the rancid stench of the world. Every hazy cigar cloud, every particle of smog in the air, and every cheap ass perfume. 
  

  
But, you ask, what about good smells, like food or flowers? First off, it's not like I smell them when I want to. Do you want to smell someone’s eggs benedict while eating dessert? No, the smell utterly overpowers it. On a rare occasion, I’ll smell something that I genuinely enjoy, and it makes me sad. It could be all the way across town, it's not like some brownie in the kitchen, it's a bakery down on Walnut street. Also, all these different smells blend together too, which means I’m smelling Cheetos, cigar smoke, and someone’s leaky septic tank all at the same time. Yeah, that’s what I thought. And flowers, I never thought they smelled that good to begin with.
  

  
I have considered getting my sense of smell dealt with multiple times before. Just destroy the whole olfactory system. But I do like enjoying how things taste… I just didn’t know. What I had was supposed to feel special, like some cool powers or something. I knew I should have been grateful, I just wasn’t, until now.
  

  
What changed? Well, food changed. Baking got realistic. You ask, what the hell does that have to do anything? Well, first, you ask too many questions, random reader, and second, I know, I wouldn’t have thought it would mean much either, but it means everything. Even if baking is realistic, it must take an incredible amount of time and energy to make, right? Technology helped with that, also, there are way more bakers now. It’s like a movement. Dancing, music, acting, writing, painting, sculpting, or whatever other artistic medium you can think of, they’re all considered inferior to baking in this society.
  

  
This means that there are a ton of cake people all over the place. It’s a political statement, I won’t get into it, but essentially the way we treat the food industry is messed up, and the bakers are taking a stand. The government won’t get off their high horse, however, and now we common folk suffer from this infestation.
  

  
Well, how bad can it really be? I mean, free cake, what’s wrong with that? Everything. I haven’t eaten cake since this whole thing started, could you? It’s the source of horror now, it's an infestation that is inescapable.
  

  
This is where I come in. You see, I can smell so well that I can smell cake. I know what is real or fake just by sniffing it. I was made for this infestation, I’m the savior who is going to get us out of it. I even have my own following now, people grouped up with me and avoid what I tell them is cake. Sometimes I lie, I know it's wrong, but I finally have a useful power. “Oh.. sorry, that house is cake, we can’t stay there for the night.” That is, of course, where I will be staying for the night.
  

  
It’s normalized now, I avoid what’s cake and consider it just a daily annoyance. I watch as those who don’t listen to me scream in horror as they embrace a cake person only to have them crumble. I watch them fall through cake floors or try to fire cake guns before getting subdued by an enemy with a real gun.
  

  
I used to think truth was in decline, no one knew what sources to trust, but now, the world has descended so much further into mistrust. I am their only source of trust. I bring truth where everywhere else brings cake. I could get used to this savior thing, I’ll just sit back in my ‘cake’ mansion, turn on the TV, and… “Breaking news, the bakers have just invented a new odorless cake.”
  

  
Fuck.
