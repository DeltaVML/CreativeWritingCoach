STORY:
================================

"So, you took the whole village by yourself?" she asked with a bemused expression as she sat on her throne of skulls.  They were topped with a red cushion as skull thrones are notoriously uncomfortable.

"Well," he answered sheepishly, "I did have Grog's help."

Grog the troll nodded as he crunched what Derek hoped was a cow's bone between his teeth.  He belched triumphantly and said, "Drek did alla werk, me just did mussles."

"That's right," Derek suddenly straightened, a little pride at his accomplishment sinking in.

"Him even got 'lected mare," Grog said, reaching for another bone.

"Got what again?" Druzella's eyes narrowed at Grog, then she looked at her red-faced husband in that way that promised either death or a night he'd never forget.  Derek tried really hard to gauge the mood.

"Mare, know when dey voat?"  Grog said between bone crunches.

"You let the villagers vote?" his wife seemed to be biting her bottom lip to keep from laughing.

"Well, it only seemed fair," he said, suddenly looking down at his muddy boots, "I mean, what's the use of conquering something if you're not going to improve upon the current system of gov..."

"Are you saying I should let the peasants hold free elections after my Dark Armies raze their kingdoms?" she sighed as she asked the question, then sipped her dark blood-red wine in anticipation.

"Now, now dear," he added quickly, "What you do with your Empire is entirely up to you!  I'm just saying that the village I conquered now has a free democratic government."

"What popoo... poopoola... how meny peeple does it taek to make village?" Grog asked, scratching a finger at the bugs in the scrawny nest on his head that passed for hair.

"I don't know if there's an exact number that would define a village, I be..." Druzella answered then laughed, "Wait, why?  How many were in the village Derek took over."

"I fail to see how that is rele..." Derek said trying to cut the troll off before he could answer.

"2!" Grog said, his green teeth suddenly showing in a smile, "Grog can count alla way to 4!"

"Derek, two people?" she was serious again, "And they voted for you?  Please tell me you got 100% of the..."

"Fitty," Grog offered before Derek could intervene, "Me was tie-breaker vote."

After his wife stopped laughing she looked at him, then bit her lip again, "Oh, don't sulk.  That's adorable.  I mean it's not bad for a first try."

"Was Drek's turd try," Grog said, "Udder two villages chased us way."

"Grog," Derek said, "Remind me to push you off a cliff if I get a chance."

"k," Grog nodded as he scratched his behind and yawned.

"Third times a charm, right?" his wife added helpfully, "You know if you want I can make you the Dark General of my 13th Legion."  She seemed to think about it for a second, "Or maybe start you off as Dark General apprentice to my real Dark General.  You know, baby steps.  In no time at all you'll be conquering your way across..."

"No thanks," he sighed and sat next to her stiletto-heeled boots looking dejected.

"Hey, come on," she said, trying to lift his spirits, "Remember that dragon you killed?"

"Waz lizzerd with horns glued..." Grog started then stopped suddenly as writhing tendrils of darkness crossed her features, "W-waz really impressive... G-Grog have to use bathroom n-now."  The troll practically ran from the throne room.

"Why?" He asked, looking up at her.

"Why what?" she said, feeling that unaccustomed warmth only he could raise in her cold heart.

"Why me?" he stood up, "You have devilishly handsome warriors that fill your ranks, some are quite literally devils now that I think about it.  You have genius sorceror's at your beck and call.  You have everything you could possibly want.  What the hell can an umemployed shepherd offer that they can't?"

"Why Derek, dear,"  she slid off of her throne, her body pressing into his.  He looked around to see all her lackeys had fled the room at some silent signal she had given, "I love your determination.  From that day you stood up to me in that field after Grog had eaten all of your sheep.  You were so serious as you stood there with your cute little crook, took a daring step toward me and slipped in that pile of sheep shit."

"I don't think I've ever heard anyone laugh that hard," he said, a smile sneaking in at the corner of his lips.

"You're the first person in my life that made me laugh," she smiled, and kissed him, "And the only person who can continue to do so.  That's why I love you so much."
