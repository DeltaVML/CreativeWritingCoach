STORY:

No one gets 50 chances to say goodbye. I guess I should feel lucky, but all I feel is numb.

Pieces of our story came out as he (me?) was fading in and out of existence, but it's probably better to start around my seventh birthday, eight months after my parents were killed. He (me? I am just going to call him Dad, because that's what he was to me for 10 years).

Dad showed up around eight months after my bio-parents were killed by a drunk driver. Eight month and already 3 foster homes, each one worse than the last. I barely remember my time in those overcrowded run-down apartments, but I remember lashing out at everything. No one wanted to deal with a little kid who would kick and scream. Violence was met with violence.

Dad showed up and rescued me. He seemed to know just what to say to calm me down. It was like he was reading my mind. He got me into therapy, and even if those eight months changed me, we were working through the trauma. I still got in trouble for hurting kids who would make jokes about my dead parents, but home was my refuge. It was safe and warm. A few smart investments by Dad ensured we had a comfortable life, even if I was occasionally an ungrateful jerk.

I was 17 and starting to look at colleges. While I was leaving school one day, one of your typical high-school bullies made a joke about my dead parents. I could feel the blood rush to my face and my fists tighten, but my Dad was there to take me to soccer practice. When I got in the car, I was fuming, but Dad talked me through it. Turns out, the bully had it much worse than me, shoes that were falling apart, maybe bag of chips for lunch, walks home to an empty house.

I took a deep breath and let his joke go. For the first time, I felt unburdened and no longer wanted revenge. I felt lighter. And then I was woken out of my revelry by the car crashing into a light pole, with my dad missing from the driver's seat.

The first time he flashed back into existence, it was quick here and then gone. Relief flooded me as I looked up and saw him running towards the car, and then nothing. My heart stopped as he faded away, and then I saw him running towards me from another angle. Eventually his flashes lasted long enough to get parts of his story out. But I was mostly too angry at him to reply.

Turns out, the accident that killed my bio-parents didn't happen like I remembered it and Dad got himself hospitalized trying to stop it. He adopted me and tried to undo the damage that already ingrained itself. Letting go of the hate changed my future, but the trauma of Dad leaving me made it so much worse.

But now I sit here alone, numb. Seeing my Dad, my future-self, blink in and out of existence, finally hearing the truth behind all the lies, wondering if it was a parent's love or just selfishness when Dad was raising me. But mostly just numb. Mission accomplished, I guess.
