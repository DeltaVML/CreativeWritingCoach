I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My first time answering a prompt, I hope this will be to your liking.  
Might be a bit dark…

“Grandpa.” The young girl called as she entered the kitchen.  
“We have another order of spaghetti.”  
“Sure thing sweetie.” The elderly man replied.  
He pointed a finger at the wet dough and cast “Dry the wet!” followed by “Water Collector!” The dough dried just enough to be cut into the proper shape and the bubble of water followed his finger into the pot waiting on the stove.With the recent law about saving resources and a big fine to whoever fail to do that, it was better to save any drop of water, the kingdom already get enough money with their ridiculous taxes.

“Please tell the guests it will be ready in a couple of minutes.”

“Yes grandpa.” The girl answered, she held a tray with several pints of nicely cold ale.

Not a minute past and the girl released a scream followed by the sound of glass shattering on the floor.

“No way out!” The old man cast and every exit from the building was closed shut.Arriving to the dining hall, he saw several guests holding a man so he won’t escape.The girl was sitting on the floor, sobbing, her palm cut deeply from a shard of glass.He quickly restored the glass and tended his grandchild wound.

“Restore nerves!”, “Restore blood!”, “Restore skin!” One after the other, the spells healed her hand, it may took a bit longer to cast, but it was more effective than a simple “heal”.

“Take her.” He gestured to an elf in the crowd.“What did you do?” He asked the suspect, eyes full of barely contained rage. “I did noth-” The suspect couldn’t finish his words as a dagger was placed very close to his neck. “He slapped her behinds!” The captor with the dagger said. “Then he threw her on the floor!”  
“It’s a lie!” The suspect yelled.  
The old man looked at his grandchild as she nodded. Even the guards who usually ignored bar fights were visibly upset at hearing this.

It was the suspect time to yell in agony as both his arms were dried, every fiber of nerve signaling in pain as they perished from dehydration.

“You came to my establishment.” The old man said. “You ate the food we made for you and you dare laying your dirty hands on my granddaughter?!”

“I’m sorry.”  
“Shut up!” This spell shattered his teeth.  
He restored hydration to the criminal’s arms, which in turn caused more pain.  
“Maybe your arms will regain motor skills, hopefully they won’t.”

He then carved ancient runes on the criminal’s arms and legs, finally he cast “surveillance”.  
“I will know if you’ll try again to harm a woman, the next time you do, well… Your remains will paint the whole street. Now begone!” and he threw him out of the now unlocked window.
