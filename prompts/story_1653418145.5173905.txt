I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

\[Poem\]

Reputation is the key to strength states Law 5 by Greene 

Segregation of how I feel versus how I react keeping me redeemed 

For my strength may not be visible, my wavelength seemingly criminal 

I keep it confidential, as we all share vulnerabilities

But once we're differential, I share the highest of my abilities

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
