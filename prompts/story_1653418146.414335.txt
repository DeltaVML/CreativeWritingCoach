I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“How utterly troublesome.” 

I tap my finger impatiently on the chains surrounding my body. 

Clink! Clink! Clink! 


I have no idea how long it has been. Unable to see the sun for what felt like aeons, my body and mind has lost track of all time. How long is a second actually? Am I really immortal or is my body just too damn resilient? Ah damn this annoying dripping! When. Will. It. Stop?! 

Scuttling. I hear scuttling. Where is it? What is happening? I feel the chains around my body becoming more brittle but I do not care. How many times have I felt like these unbreakable chains could be torn apart? Hah! As if I’m that omnipotent. No… perhaps just a bit more and I shall be… ha…hahahahahha… I might be a God! 

Bang! Crumble! 

“Let there be light” were the first words that came to mind when a beam of light landed on my skin for the first time in… some length of time.
Oh why did it have to be a holy scripture quote. Perhaps the God of those crusaders has chosen to show me his hypocritical mercy. No, impossible. That damned entity is too arrogant to ever do that. Of course I would know since he chose to kill firstborn children instead of smiting a devious goblin of a man that ruled some small desert empire. But… what if it really is him? 

My ears perk. My head snaps. Sound… no not the dripping! Voices… What language is this? What sort of gibberish is being uttered upon my ears? It does not matter, you buffoons come free me now!

“You hear that? Sounded like someone screaming.”

“Don’t be stupid Mohammed, how could there be voices in a hole that has never been discovered before?”

“Hmm. Yes you’re right. I guess I’m just being paranoid. Either way, who knew there was such a large deep cave underneath the Dead Sea. If I didn’t know any better, I would have expected it to be a colossal man made structure.” 

“Yes, keep playing those alien games about precursors and all that. I’ll just be here focused on the actual history of our planet.” 

“Apologies Professor.” 

“Hey. I see something down there. It’s shining? Is that silver? You have better eyes than me Mohammed, go look in the direction I’m pointing at.”

“Hmmm. It seems to be silver metal. But they look like chains… what on reach could chains be doing down here?” 

“Maybe those video games were onto something after all…”

I sniff the faint breeze that managed to squeeze through the hole those voices had made. Never, would I have missed this smell until now. Such a relaxing scent but… why is it relaxing? Am I not below the Lake of Yarva Yajan? Interesting… I splat out my tongue to lick the breeze, to taste it as its particles landed on my tongue. While savouring the taste of land and water, my eyes widen in ecstasy. 

No… salt… hahahahaha… There is no salt! Yarva Yajan you pitiful man, I will hunt you down!!! 

——————

It all started with the crack of a link in a long, powerful chain. With one unlocking does the rest unfurl into their composite materials. Such was the state of human history. The followers of Yarva Yajan could not protect the legacy of their Lord and Saviour. They let their scriptures and teachings be lost to the sands of time. Oh was their blight so pitiful. 
In contrast, the blunder of the ignorant humans was relished by Asmongold, the flame Titan. His charcoal black body finally lit up after so long as he descended to the skies with two bloody heads ensnared in his claw-like hands. 

As the brightness of the sun dwindled to signify the end of day, Asmongold’s body illuminated the skies instead with soaring flame pillars from above.

With Asmongold’s cage of salt gone, future historians are left to wonder. Was this a punishment from the divine or just the cogs of fate continuously turning?
