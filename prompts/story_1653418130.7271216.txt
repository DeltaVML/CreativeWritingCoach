I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I blinked in confusion, as my smiling friends and family laughed, clapped each other on the back, and fist bumped each other triumphantly. It had been a weird day.

When I got off work, what seemed like only minutes ago, a stranger asked me for the time. When I pulled out my phone and looked down to check, someone threw a black bag over my head, cinched it tight, and I suddenly felt multiple sets of hands snatch my phone, hoist me up despite my struggling, and toss me roughly into a vehicle. I heard a sliding door close, tires squeal, and then I felt a  pinprick at my neck, and blacked out.

The next thing I knew, I was standing up, the black bag was pulled off my head, and I was surrounded by loved ones, who all shouted "SURPRISE!" and then set about congratulating me about how good they got me.

Well, they weren't wrong. I did not see that coming.

"Mom?" I began, hesitantly.

"Yes, sweetie?" Mom said, still chuckling and beaming at me.

"I, um, I just got literally *black-bagged* off the street, like I called Xi Jingping 'Winnie the Pooh' in the middle of Beijing." I said, in a small voice.

She laughed, placing an arm around Dad's waist, and leaning against him fondly. "Well, that part was *your father's* idea."

Dad grinned, and winked, pointing finger-guns at me. "Gotcha, kiddo!"

"Dad!" I snapped. "I'm pretty sure those psychos *drugged* me on the way here!"

The old man snorted, and crossed his arms. "Yeah?" he said, raising his eyebrows, challengingly. "So you don't use recreational drugs, son?"

"Of for f--" I began, then stopped short. It was my Mom and Dad, after all. "You caught me in my room with weed *one time* in high school, Dad! *One time!* I don't even smoke anymore!*"*

"And when exactly *was* the last time you used recreational drugs, son?" Mom asked, curiously.

I blinked. "I mean, I don't know, I think...freshman year, in college? I was gaining weight and I thought it was screwing with my grades, so I stopped. Look, what does this have to do anything?"

Mom shrugged. That was when I noticed it. The wall behind them...it was bright, and clean. Too clean. I mean, I keep my situation in check at home, but this was like *spotlessly* clean, fresh-paint, not a speck of dust anywhere. I squinted at the texture of the wall but before I could put my finger on what was wrong, Emma sidled up to me, and kissed me on the cheek.

I turned to look at my girlfriend, accusingly. "Were *you* in on this, too?"

She grinned mischievously. "Yeah! Funny, right, babe?"

"No!" I cried. "I was kidnapped and drugged!"

"Aww, I'm sorry." she said, sticking out her lower lip sadly.  She leaned in close, and stage-whispered into my ear. "I could make it up to you later...by having *sex."*

I paled.

"Babe!" I cried, horrified, my cheeks turning bright red. "My parents are *right there!"*

"Oh well there's nothing to be ashamed of, son." Dad said, smiling broadly. "Sexual activity is normative for your age group and social demographic."

"What?" I exclaimed.

"On a scale of one to ten, how often do you engage in intercourse?" Mom said, cocking her said to one side.

"Mom!" I screamed in horror, placing my hands on the sides of my head.

And then I felt it. Hard plastic.

"What the..." I said, feeling at my head.

"Uh, don't do that son!" Dad said, quickly.

"It's very bad manners!" Mom added.

"We can have sex right now, if you stop!" Emma chimed in, tugging at my arm.

I found the edges of the device on my head, and jerked it upwards -- it hurt like ripping off a band-aid, like the headset had been *glued* to my face!

And there I was. Standing in a blank gray room.

Staring into the cold, blank, alien face...of *Mark Zuckerberg.*

I screamed in surprise.

He smiled.

I screamed in *terror.*

Still smiling, he raised a bony finger to my lips, and somehow made a loud "Shhhh" sound without moving his own mouth in the slightest.

I quieted down. I didn't *dare* do otherwise. He lowered his finger.

"Well, it looks like our latest Metaverse Market Research tool needs a little more fine tuning." he said, with monotone cheerfulness, his rictus smile never touching his unblinking eyes. "It appears we still lack the necessary background to accurately simulate a user's social and family groups, in order to gather marketable user data in a naturalistic setting."

"This...this was for market research?" I stammered, incredulously.

"Yes. Thank you for agreeing to participate." he said, mildly.

"I didn't agree to this!" I exclaimed, outraged.

"It's all in the Terms of Use." he said, dismissively. "Your compensation will be forthcoming when you are returned."

"R-returned?" I asked.

And then the black bag dropped over my head again.

When I woke, I was sitting in my car. On the passenger seat next to me, there was a stack of crisp $100 bills.  That, and a photograph.

It was a signed picture of Zuckerberg, giving that horrible lifeless smile, an unnaturally long forefinger pressed to his lips.
