STORY:

Kent Allard just wanted a quiet life. Sure, some wouldn't call him a good person. Taking hostages without actually threatening their lives, robbing banks while not actually keeping the money, and failed contract killings never looked good on a resume, but he kept up and coming superheros employed. How would a hero learn to save the world if they hadn't so much as stopped a mugging? But then this guy came in and took his place. That upstart calling himself a "Khan", stealing money, killing folks, and turning people into mind-controlled slave-soldiers, that should not be able to stand. Unfortunately, the small time heroes that had started emerging weren't succeeding in foiling him, that none of them were willing to kill the man didn't help matters. Big time guys weren't going to help either, the ongoing war was keeping The Rocketeer busy, the current Solomon Kane was doing *something* in Africa, and that he kept his antics to one city meant that Doc Savage had far bigger problems to deal with. It was another day of Kent ranting about the subject to himself that he a thought occurred to him.

'They always say to do something yourself if you want it done right... I might not be a spring chicken, but I've got some years in me.' From that thought, he called to his butler. "Call Margot Lane."

"Did she not change her phone number, sir?"

"On the *other* phone." He said as he stood up and stalked toward a dusty dresser, bringing out a costume he had not worn in years to this point. "I'm bringing my Agents back in. And tell her to get that Cranston kid here too, he could use some lessons." While his villainous days were behind him, he still had many contacts in the Underworld, and through Margot Lane, he had resources to spare. Not to the level of Doc Savage, but enough to take down that so-called Khan.

"Are you certain you'd like to risk the death penalty, sir?"

"If it means that that damned Khan goes silent, yes." Allard's voice had changed at that point, a low raspy voice with an almost cackling cadence. It felt... fun, taking on the form again. It wasn't the intended purpose, but if anyone was going to finally take down that upstart Khan, it was going to be the city's darkest knight.

After all, who better than him knew the evil that lurked in the hearts of men?
