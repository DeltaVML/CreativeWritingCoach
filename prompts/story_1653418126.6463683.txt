STORY:
================================

part 1: you wake up, to notice... you're fifteen again! but you look at your phone, to see it's not 2000. it's 2022. you wipe your eyes, as you think you saw something else. you remember you have work today, you quickly make some toast, and bolt out the door. you kept on running. faster and faster you run. your favourite song plays, "oh my! feels like i don't try!" (everybody loves me - one republic) the music played on, and on. you get to work on time. you glance at your phone. "Alert! Alert! There has been a problem with The Simulator's realism and age properties.  Many glitches have occurred within the last few days. The Maintenance will fix this soon." you think about this for a second. as you reach for the phone, you bug out. alas, you end up in The Glitch Room. you walk around. people... are npc's here.  atleast, they act like npc's. you hear, "Hello. You are here because The Simulator either deleted you, or you discovered a glitch. Either way, The Maintenance is currently working on trying to bring you back online. Now, This is not heaven or hell, exactly. This is The Glitch Room. Soon, you will be accompanied by realistic humans. This room shall soon look like The Simulation that you live in." silence. pure silence.

 
part 2:  after a while though, you walk around the field the voice spoke about. you wander as the people make noise. you go back to The Simulation. you've been there for... 12 hours!? what!? you rush home.  your discord friends  have been quote en quote *bugging* you for the past couple hours. you respond. "guys  what the fuck just happened, i got teleported to a black room ALSO JOIN THE DAMN VC GUYS" on the voice chat, you continue on explaining what happened. "wilbur," your best friend says. "that was a pretty insane explanation tbh" you swear it was real. you end the call. 



part 3: you sigh a heavy sigh, and get up. you get to the fridge and make dinner, as always. (writers block, check back later)
