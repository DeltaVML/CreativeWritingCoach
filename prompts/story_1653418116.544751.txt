I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Slice. Slice. Slice.

It came apart so easily, he mused.

Slice. Slice. Squish.

It was leaking again, he’d have to be more careful.

Squish. Squish. Squish.

Well, there was nothing for it now.

The colors pooled together, rivulets of crimson wound their way down the shattered and stained mass. At last they pooled on the porcelain floor, gathering with the cast off chunks idly flicked away.

It had been so pretty when he started. It was beautiful. It was artwork. It was ruined and reduced and ruptured and wretched and weak and worthless and-

No, there was no time for that now. No time for anything except wiping away the trickling evidence of his error in judgement. Soon, the unblinking eye would be upon him, and he would learn whether he had succeeded, or if his sacrifice and torture was all for naught.

He had poured much of himself into his suffering creation. It repaid him with a soft gurgle, the last gasp it would ever emit. He cursed it, as much as it had cursed him.

The work had proven far more painful than he anticipated. He knew the cost, he thought, but the real cost was paid not in coin or sweat, but from his rapidly thinning sanity. Not to say that the cost in coin hadn’t weighed heavily on him. Each component was far more expensive than he realized at the outset, and some were deceptively rare.

It had taken ages to acquire everything he needed. There were few that possessed them. And they were not moved by his plight, the countless letters of inquiry he had sent were silent testament to that.

Even the knowledge of it had cost him dearly. And he paid a price that could not be measured in mundane currencies. For to obtain this knowledge, he had become a betrayer, stealing the secrets from his mentor, cajoling them into surrendering each drip of information until at last he had collected it all.

When his mentor learned of the foul deed, he found himself banished from their sight. No matter how he pleaded, they refused to meet his gaze. It was cold comfort to know that this was the way of master and apprentice. The way his mentor had learned the secrets of the trade, through their own act of treachery many moons ago.

From above, a light. It was time.

He set forth the pitiful offering. It seemed so meagre now. Unworthy of such an audience.

He held back a tear at the thought of all he had lost in pursuit of his dreams.

Up it rose, higher and higher, the broken body torn asunder and carried up to the unblinking eye.

There was a blinding flash followed by a chorus of laughter. Had he failed?

Only they could judge him now.

One of the slices slumped over on its side, filling the void left by its missing brethren. The cherries spilled out from beneath its papery skin, barely restrained by the rich oozing caramel and apples soaked in an exotic blend of spices from the far corners of the globe. It was a bold combination, one his mother had been perfecting for years, a modification of the simple cherry tarts she ate as a young girl.

The judges frowned, scribbling in their notebooks. They seemed displeased, but then, when all seemed lost, one spoke:

“Points for creativity, depth of flavor, a fine crust leaning towards tender rather than flaky…”

The printed photographs taken only moments earlier were distributed amongst those present, stuffed away alongside countless other hopes and prayers captured in chemical-impregnated cellulose.

She looked deep into his despairing eyes, drinking in his muted, quivering form, and spake thus:

“Come now, cheer up, will you? The pie tastes great! What’s in it, anyway?”
