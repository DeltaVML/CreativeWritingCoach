STORY:

The moon was awefully bright that night, more than usual. The aura emanating making most of the edge of the forest easily distinguishable from the otherwise dark backdrop. She started to approach me slowly, unsure what to expect. 

My tail started to form first underneath my clothing, quickly followed by my facial features and ears. She gasped, but didnt halt her slow advance however, as my transformation started in front of her eyes.
My legs were next, as i fell to all fours, ripping my favorite attire, ruining my shoes. My fur had formed underneath in such a way it had made my pants slide majority of the way off, but still stuck on my hindlegs. 

I shook my pants off, and frantically started scratching at my chest and neck with a hind paw, trying to break free of the remaining taters that was my shirt. I heard a slight giggling and looked up. She was looking at me, he hand to her mouth holding back laughter. I eventually break the rest free and shake it aside. I instinctively start to run towards to forest but then look behind me towards her and my pile of rags on the rocky pathway. I slowly trot back towards her and get to my clothing. 

"I hope you didnt like those clothes too much", she said kneeling down a good 20 feet away. I look at her and cock my head. She giggles again. "Cute", she says, reaching her hand out. I wag my tail and i see it wagging in the corner of my eye. I nip at it and start to chase it in a circle. I start growling and really start going after it, determined to make my damn tail stop wagging once and for all. 

"Well," she begins, "this isnt exactly barking at a lamppost like you said, but this is still quite amusing." I stop for a brief moment and look at her again, tail in my maw, and notice she has her phone out. She's recording me! I bark loudly twice in her direction, releasing my tail, the first one getting her to jump slightly. "What? You really expect me to not record this?" I growl and get low to the ground, staring at her intently, tail swaying rhythmically. I bound towards her and jump past her, knocking her over in the process. 

"What are you doing??" She asks, trying to fix her hair. I ignore her and find the nearest lamppost and start howling at it. One by one, a chorus of howls from various directions start form, eventually forming a eerie yet beautiful song. "Woah, how many of your kind are really out here without us knowing...?"
