I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“Wait a second, did you say the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?? Palpatine is clearly manipulating you to the dark side Anakin!”

“How can this be? This is unfair! First I am not granted master, then my close friend manipulates me?!”

“This is hard too take in, I know, but you must not allow yourself to be in denial. Meditate on this, I beg you Anakin.”

“I will kill him myself!” 

“I feel that is unwise, as it could only surface the dark side more. Remember the sand people, we can’t let you relapse to that point again.”

“AHHH..the men..the women..and even the children too! But they were ANIMALS doctor, I slaughtered them like animals!”

“Breathe Anakin..1,2,3,4.. you can’t let those memories awaken that hatred, however, it is important that you allow it to pass through your mind peacefully.” 

“Thank you, I nearly lost it there. I am just glad those were only sand people children after re-evaluating, and not real younglings!”

“Good, it is useful too see these kinds of memories from a new perspective, it will help you move on.”

“Yes, but what about Palpatine now? How do I proceed there?”

“You may want too find further evidence of his dark nature..then confront a trusted fellow master-sorry, Jedi councillor with the proof.”

“A wise plan, thank you for the guidance, you are nearly as wise as Yoda himself.”

“Your welcome Anakin, although a therapist speaking in riddles backwards likely wouldn’t be so useful..hah.”

“You have a point.”

“Let’s move on, tell me about this new trick Obi wan has taught you.”

“Well, it all starts with having the high ground.”
