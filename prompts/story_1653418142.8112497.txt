I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Oh geez, this’ll be fun. I’ve always wanted to do something like this.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even with my twenty one years of training and experience, I’m unable to prevent the smirk that slowly spreads across my face. I’m a normal looking dude just under the average height for an American male. I decided long ago that whoever created me must hate me for not giving me those two extra inches. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Just to be absolutely certain, ma’am. You said that you wanted me to hunt down the Mole, right?” I barely manage to keep the amusement out of my voice.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Are you getting senile? Yes! Now get to it! I don’t have time to waste on your shenanigans.” The sharp reply came.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”With all due respect, ma’am, your mom had plenty of time for my ‘shenanigans’.” I reply shamelessly, having known this woman for literally half my life.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Granted, I’ve never said anything remotely similar to her before. But things have changed now.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The shock and confusion is evident in her voice, even over the phone. “What?” I imagine her face as she suddenly figures it out, and have to suppress another gleeful laugh. “Derrick… no.” I can hear the depression and utter betrayal in her voice. “Not you too.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Yes, ma’am. I’m afraid so.” I suddenly doubt whether we’re talking about the same thing, so I quickly clarify. “I’m the spy.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Then you know I’m going to kill you myself.” The voice on the other end has lost all emotion and warmth. It’s a dead voice.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just as I had imagined.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Why ma’am, I would be insulted if anything but the best came after me.” I then hang up the phone and toss it into the nearby fireplace. Just to be safe.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I stand up and stretch, cracking my knuckles and popping my back. I close my eyes and breathe deeply through my nostrils, and bring the countdown going on in the back of my mind to the forefront. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Three.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Two. I step forward to the open window, eyes still closed, and yawn.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One. I open my eyes and perform a perfect dive through the open window into the lake twenty feet below. God, I love Venice. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The room I was in explodes, soon followed by the rest of the rooms in the building. Soon, my boss’ll be on my tail with a horde of our best agents. But they won’t be looking in Venice. They’ll be looking in Paris. Just one short plane ride away. But they won’t come to Venice. They’ll follow the clues I left all the way back to the States, where they’ll find my dead body. They’ll figure out that I committed suicide, and be confused as all get out, not getting the joke at all. But that’s okay. I’ll be in Venice living the life of a king. And that building I just blew up? Dramatic effect. Pure and simple. Just like my deal with the outside parties. None of the other agents are going to be rich anytime soon. But me? I’m loaded from all the double dealing. They don’t know what they’re missing out on, and never will.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I love being over competent.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{Finis Fabulae}
