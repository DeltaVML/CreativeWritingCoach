STORY:
================================

The world ended on May 15th, 2022.

Except for Marc Clayton. But just barely.

He was one part brilliant scientist with degrees in more fields than Vienna, and several parts alcoholic. The proof were in the numerous doomsday machines, as high-functioning as he is, created while inebriated. Clayton is the envy of even the most stone-cold scientist while sober, and the object of jealousy of the drunkest supervillain.

It was why Clayton didn’t attend many parties. Either side of him would be welcome in the light overworld or dark underbelly—but he was irrevocably fused into one person. And so, despite being banned from nearly every party in the city, he was able to procure—and drink—a number of bottles that could have made an elephant woozy.

But on that May 15th night, the world didn’t revolve around Marc Clayton. Well, it did, on accounts of the irresponsible amount of alcohol imbibed that night. So, from his perspective, the world felt like it revolved around him, but it was otherwise physically and metaphorically not.

Instead, the world physically and metaphorically revolved around the little thing that Marc Clayton held in his hands, just a little larger than a small tortoise. Though fine motor skills should be at a premium, Clayton’s fingers had somehow gingerly put the whole thing together, with its mass of wires cleanly hidden by a smooth, metallic shell that domed around the whole thing. If you brought it up to your ear, you might hear something along the lines of these:

ticktickticktickticktickticktickticktick

Thought the scientist walked as straight as a drunk man that was hungover, then drunk some more, and repeated that process for about a week, his hands held onto the little thing like a devout acolyte holding to their cult’s most precious artifact.

Because it was. The cult was not yet formed. But the artifact was certainly precious.

Though Clayton had built the thing, he didn’t quite know what it was for. It was like he was a different person entirely while intoxicated, building something that only his mind and fingers could manage, but had not reached. All he knew was that he had to protect it with his life, even as he clumsily stumbled into a dark alleyway that rankled like multiple murders had occurred there, their bodies and secrets left to rot in every crevice.

It was here, of course, where Marc Clayton should have met his end.

As the shadows melded into each other and gave birth to living, breathing forms, the scientist’s bleary eyes barely registered the now-monsters that stood in front of him. Each held glinting steel in their hands, and terrible thoughts in their heads.

But then, the machine ticktickticked to life. In seconds, everything was vaporized, leaving nothing but the artifact sitting in white space.
It pondered what it had done. Because it was the sort of machine that could do that.

And within another batch of seconds, a world was remade and renewed. Clayton stood there, his creation in his hands, blinking.

Weren’t there a few people just in front of him? What had happened to them?

And then Marc realized that he was thinking clearly. It was the part of himself that he didn’t quite like. Too concerned with saving the world, and trying to do great things, and trying to reinvent himself in new ways.

He stared at the metallic domed thing in his hands, not quite remembering how that thing found itself in his palms. Unlike drunk Marc, sober Marc simply placed the thing in his pocket, and continued walking onwards back to his home. Perhaps he would pick up more bottles along the way.

All the while, the artifact thought. The world had ended and was brought back to life in instants. There were a lot of things it could do.

There are a lot of things it will do.
