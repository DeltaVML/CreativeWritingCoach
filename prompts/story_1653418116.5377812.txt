STORY:

The mass of tentacles and pus slithered across the room with wet, squelching sounds, unbothered by any manner of obstacle in its way, leaving behind only a thick, gooey substance of green slime that smelled of rotten seaweed and decaying meat. Several antennae atop its deformed cranium perked up and scanned the area, emanating head-crushing thumps with each wiggle - enough to make a human fall to the knees and shout, begging for death.

It stood there, nearly motionless, for a few moments, as if waiting for something that never came, much to its satisfaction. The outcome satisfactory to its hideous designs, it turned back to whence it came and with increasingly moist sounds made its way back to the den - a hole of black, craggy substance filled with darkness and forgotten nightmares. Inside, another abomination of smaller proportions lay in wait.

Ϩⲉⲉ? Ⲓⲧ ⲱⲁ𝛓 ⲛⲟⲧⲏⲓⲛ𝓰 ⲃ𐌵ⲧ ⲁ 𝛓ⲟ𐌵ⲛⲇ, ⲣ𐌵ⲙⲣⲕⲓⲛ. *(See? It was nothing but a sound, pumpkin.)*

The large mass directed these screeches towards the smaller one that was currently trembling beneath a pile of black dirt.

Ⲁꞅⲉ ⲩⲟ𐌵 𝛓𐌵ꞅⲉ ⲙ𐌵ⲙ? *(Are you sure mum?)*

The small creature replied, its vocations of far higher pitch than the other, enough to shatter glass and minds alike.

Ⲟ𝓯 ⲥⲟ𐌵ꞅ𝛓ⲉ 𝛓ⲱⲉⲉⲧⲓⲉ. Ⲛⲟⲱ, ⲩⲟ𐌵 ⲛⲉⲉⲇ ⲧⲟ 𝓰ⲟ ⲃⲁⲥⲕ ⲧⲟ ⲃⲉⲇ, ⲟⲕⲁⲩ? *(Of course sweetie. Now, you need to go back to bed, okay?)*

The larger mass, after several gurgling sounds, spat out an additional layer of dirt to cover the smaller tentacled horror. Several half-digested maggots could be seen writhing in the forsaken earth, much to the large mass' satisfaction.

The small mass, no longer trembling, ceased all movement altogether, now in a death-like stiffness. The tentacle monstrosity looming over it crawled towards the exit of the hovel with as little sound as its terrible frame allowed. At the edge of the precipice, it turned and quietly screeched some parting vocations.

Ϩ𝓵ⲉⲉⲣ ⲱⲉ𝓵𝓵 ⲣ𐌵ⲙⲣⲕⲓⲛ. *(Sleep well pumpkin.)*
