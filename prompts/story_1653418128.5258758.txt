STORY:
================================

  "Yup!" I yelled, yanking the reins on my horse, Apple Pie. She neighed and ran faster.

  "Come back here, peasant!" The baker's son yelled, chasing me and running with all his might. But try as he may, he couldn't catch me. Me and Apple Pie made many turns through the forest to make sure his slow feet shouldn't catch us, and finally stopped at the abandoned stables.

  Apple Pie and I threw ourselves on the floor, and panted. I tiredly took the muffins out of Apple Pie's horse pouch and we both ate our only meal of the day. The sky was turning dark and I was trying to get comfortable so I could look at the stars. When I saw my favorite star, (I  named it) Apple Pie, I  smiled, and was ABOUT TO DRIFT ASLEEP when I heard a voice call,

  "You there!"

  I immediately sat up and turned my head 180 degrees both ways. 

  *Musta heard somethin'...*, I thought, but when I went back to lie down, I saw a white man's face in mine.

  "Ah!" I screamed, jumping up.

  "Interesting. I never thought I would see anyone living in this desolate area." he said with his hands on his chin. He had chin-length blonde hair, and was dressed like a prince without a crown. "I guess I'll have to report this..."

  "Wait. You went into MY territory without even asking, and you're not even going to name yourself?" I asked him.

  He turned around with a smile. "Oh, well if I must! My name is Demetrius Demarcus Bartholemew James the third. And what might you call yourself?"

  "Huh?" I asked, with my arched back, scratching my behind. "My name is Etoile. Well, at least that's what I call myself since I haven't seen my parents, ever."

  "Oh, that's not nice. Well, are there any accomodations I can make for to have a decent abode?" he asked me.

  "Shhhh! Apple Pie's sleeping!" I whisper yelled. "And yeah, I guess I'd like that." He smiled and led me in a direction I had gone in once before. It was the direction of my destroyed hometown. I closed my eyes as I walked a sleepy Apple Pie through the forest. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing the town that I lived in being walked in by the same nobles that destroyed it. Nobles my butt.

  As he led me, I stepped on a twig and almost let go of Apple Pie and tripped, but Demetrius caught me.

  "Thank you, Demetrius."

  "Well, that is the reason for my being a noble isn't it?" I slowly opened my eyes.

  "A... what?"

   "A noble! I'm here for your aid!"

  I stared at his face, which was blurry in the dark. *What?*
