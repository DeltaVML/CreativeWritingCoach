STORY:

Medena wouldn't have thought that she would find warmth around the cold body of Medusa. Her warmth came from the way she spoke, the way she behaved around Medena. She even had concerns and felt the burden of mundane stuff such as that morning when she looked into the clear water surface and sighed because the snakes were a mess. Medusa explained that sometimes they got moody and wiggled in all directions making her look like a buffoon.

'What is the reason for that smirk?' Medusa's voice came from behind Medena's head.

'Oh, nothing.' Medena lifted her head as if her blind eyes could see the one holding her. She offered Medusa a smile.

'You know,' Medena added as she leaned her head on Medusa's chest. 'I wish I could see you.'

Medena could hear the snakes slither, giving away Medusa's surprise. For someone with her reputation she was also like an open book. Medena had never met someone so showing of their emotions and to her it felt like honesty. Medusa was the most honest person she had ever met.

'You once told me that never in your life have you wished to see.' Medusa's answer came after a couple heartbeats. 'That sight would make the world you perceive lose its beauty.'

Medena raised her head and offered another smile. She heard the snakes move and then go completely quiet, they were probably looking at her as well.

'It would lose nothing.'
