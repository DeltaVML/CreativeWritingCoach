STORY:
================================

"Only the dead are immortal."

With very few exceptions (and I am not one), only the dead gain immortality. They do this through deeds and actions, the legacy they leave behind. Men like Washington and Lincon let a legacy shine, leaving a great country. Others take the easy path. Hitler killed enough people and caused enough ruckus that few will forget him. Change history, and be at the head. Having a funny mustache or being short helps too.

I took the easy way.

They locked up my corpse and left it to rot. As for me, I have just sat here waiting. I heard they were about to open the door, and based on the hushed tones, they still fear me. After all these centuries, they fear a body. why, it must be a pile of bones now! 

The guard wakes with a start- "What the hell kind of dream was that?" 

I laugh, and the guard shivers. He has no idea who's bench he sat on. He gets up and walks off. Oh how I love messing with their feeble minds. I can't wait until they dispose of that corpse, oh the confusion and panic I will cause. I may be dead, but I still have a few tricks up my sleeve...
