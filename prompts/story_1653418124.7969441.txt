STORY:
================================

It is said that any program can be created simply by copying and pasting from this sacred place: Stack Overflow. No matter how complex or simple, it would be possible. 

The search began with a basic browser window, this relic machine came with one built in called google chrome. Was this the google that nearly achieved world domination in our history? Anyway, it didn’t matter, google was preached too be the path to Stack Overflow. 

After waiting a little too long, the browser opened to a page with a solitary search bar in the middle. I think this is where I enter Stack Overflow, and the letters are slowly but surely typed in. 

As the letters appeared on the search bar, sentences formed within a box below:
‘Stacy’s Mom has got it going on classic’
K was entered:
‘Stacking cups world champion’
What are all these weird suggestions? I thought google would guide me there.
Oh well, I will keep typing.

Finally, it was all entered, now the box showed things that made sense. Enter, now let’s see what happens. At the top of the page, there was now a number, it showed there were millions of results! This wouldn’t be any easy task. 

Hours pass, I have sifted through results from dozens of pages of this search. So far it all seems like gibberish, and the more pages I visit, the more confused I am becoming. This was a gargantuan task, and the only thing I have learnt so far is the importance of this semi-colon thing.

Restarting the research from the beginning was the best idea, time too search through all one hundred tabs again. This must be what it feels like too be an ancient developer.
