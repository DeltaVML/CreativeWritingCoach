STORY:
================================

(This is part one, I apologize for my extensive writing) 

"Another cup of tea, dearie?" Mrs Spencer has been pouring one cup after another for me for the last couple of minutes. It's not my fault though that the cup is basically like a shot glass to me now.

I've squeezed myself uncomfortably into her previously already small living room, squinched onto her little cotton couch. The tail is bothering me a bit, but I have grown more used to it than in the beginning.

The old lady gives me a shaky smile, leaning hard on her cane so that she won't fall. It's been an hour since I happened to get her cat out of the tree next to the house, but she has already taken to me like a girl scout selling cookies. I politely nip on my tea, draining the cup of it's contents with a single sip. "Thank you for the tea, ma'am, but I should probably get going."

*Before a neighbor calls the cops on the giant lizard that's crouched down in your house.*

She gently pats my giant claw, giving a rusty laugh. "Nonsense my dear, you can stay for as long as you want for helping poor Mister Scribbers." The furball she's talking about has backed itself into a corner, as far from me as possible while while occasionally hissing at me and growling.

I slowly shake my head, very observant over the slightest movement. Otherwise I'd destroy this whole house. So before I'll have to sneeze, I rather get out of here. "Thanks again, Mrs Spencer, but I should really leave." *She's not gonna let me leave without a good excuse.* "My mom's making pasta today and I don't wanna miss it and make her mad."

Not that she's gonna be mad anyway. I wonder how long it'll take before she starts panicking when she realizes I'm gone. Not at Justin's, not at Kelv's place. I just left home and didn't get back. 

Not that it matters. She's going to freak out anyway and I'd rather let her be torn over my disappearance than be horrified at the giant lizard that her son turned into over night. She might also not recognize me now. 
I'm a giant, scaly winged elder-lich being with giant claws and giant teeth. Judging by the reactions of people, I'm freaking terrifying. 

The old lady gives a look of surprise before giving an understanding nod. "Oh I see, then of course."
She shuffles about in the direction of the tiled kitchen, still talking on her way. "But I'd like to give you some of these biscuits I made, with chocolate chips and strawberry glazing. It's the least for your help." 

I can't begin to protest before she returns, hands full with some Tupperware box overflowing with baked goodies. Then again, any amount of food that keeps this giant from starving is better than nothing.

-------

I carefully clamber out of the front door, peering through the streets. There aren't as many people around here and most of them are luckily distracted, mowing the lawn or talking over their neat white fences.

I don't even know how the heck I got into the house in the first place, but apparently this skinbag is more squishy than sturdy. *All the wishes and hopes for a six-pack are gone.* I sigh before I feel something like a bug tucking at my tail. Turns out it's just the old lady, who wanted to wish me goodbye. "Take care, young man!" She shouts, petting the horned tail. I nod back to her in gratitude. Aside from Kim, she's been the only one so far how didn't freak out at my sight.

I mean Kim did freak out, but she's pretty smart. She figured it out pretty fast as well.

There are screams of shock and terror coming from around me, with people now pointing at me. My wings span out and push me off from the ground, high enough so I can't hear them. The might of the air being stirred causes many of them to tumble and fall. I glimpse at the old lady. She's still standing at the porch, waving up at me, laughing at the chaos around her.

Dunno how it's amusing to her, but I think it's more of the surprise of how powerful I am that just flying away causes them to trip. Maybe it's something to do with old people wisdom or something that grandma always talked about. Who knows.
