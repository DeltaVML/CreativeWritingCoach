STORY:

I stepped outside to test out my new high level. But before AI could cast anything, a small translucent box popped up in front of me.

I'd only heard of these things once before. A Glitch Auditor is what it's called. It remained there for a few seconds, spit out a red slip, and vanished. The red slip floated to the ground and I picked it up.

It read:

**ERROR 477: RECURSIVE EXPERIENCE REWARD**

A moment later, I checked my xp, and it had been reset to what it was before.

Apparently a spider I'd crushed earlier died in such a way that I was rewarded the kill xp an infinite number of times, capping out my level. It had finished calculating while I was asleep and rewarded all the xp at once.

Bummer. I wanted to see what "Flame Lance" does.
