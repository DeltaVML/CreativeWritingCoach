I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I stepped outside to test out my new high level. But before AI could cast anything, a small translucent box popped up in front of me.

I'd only heard of these things once before. A Glitch Auditor is what it's called. It remained there for a few seconds, spit out a red slip, and vanished. The red slip floated to the ground and I picked it up.

It read:

**ERROR 477: RECURSIVE EXPERIENCE REWARD**

A moment later, I checked my xp, and it had been reset to what it was before.

Apparently a spider I'd crushed earlier died in such a way that I was rewarded the kill xp an infinite number of times, capping out my level. It had finished calculating while I was asleep and rewarded all the xp at once.

Bummer. I wanted to see what "Flame Lance" does.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
