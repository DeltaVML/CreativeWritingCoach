STORY:
================================

  After I tried for so long to find the joy in this life I’m  finally deciding to make a decision I should have made long ago. No one will miss me. Everyone has already told me that the world would be better off with out me. So after thirty years of fighting this shitty life I’m finally going to take it. And I know just how I’ll do it. I’m having a strange feeling of peace but what I’m really looking forward to is flying of that building. I always dreamed of flying, even as a kid I would always jump from the highest sand piles even if it was for two seconds of air time. Now the building is down town so I could just leave everything behind, pick up a bottle of whiskey and float away into the after life. So two rights and a left. The lady in the store seems pretty chipper today we usually have conversations on a regular basis but I’m not in a chatty mood today. “Mr. Dennis so nice to see you today how are the kids” she asks with an irritating smile. Oh right, I have kids and a nagging wife who also has a nagging family, that on a regular basis, I have to see a therapist for. “Hello Ms. Ann, yes they are fine” I reply, quickly placing on the counter, now two bottles of whiskey. I just want to get out of this store, away from people, to enjoy my drink and die in peace. After Ms. Ann rings me up I quickly place down a hundred dollar bill and rush out the store. I wasn’t really bothered with the change. I cracked the top on one of the bottles and quickly placed the other in my laptop bag. Building is about three blocks away I should finish one bottle by the time I get there and I’ll drink the other on the roof. I haven’t drink this fast since those college frat parties. What a time I use to have. But I need to slow down my legs are definitely loosening up at this point. I step into the street to accomplish my last block and realize I’m the only one crossing, but before I knew it I looked to my right to see a bus coming head on. Great just my luck. I couldn’t move fast enough before I heard all of my bones crushing underneath the wheels. I couldn’t even scream. I just let the pain swallow me as I look up at the tall building wishing the spot I was laying in had come a little later. As everything starts to get darker I find a sense of peace as I accept that the mission has been accomplished regardless of how it happened. So is death just darkness? I feel no pain anymore. Something doesn’t feel right. Wait am I in a hospital? No way. I can hear the machines beeping in my ear, they are faint but I still hear them. 

Two days later 
   Maybe it was all just a dream. As I start to wake up I see my wife standing over me.   I don’t have to explain myself and I don’t have the energy either. Why didn’t I die? “Well Mr. Dennis you have an angel looking over you. It was a miracle you survived that accident. Though your alcohol levels were pretty high you managed to survive. It really is still a mystery that even your body is healing itself. Two collapsed lungs, broken spine, broken neck, crushed windpipe. I mean the list goes on.” The doctor is trying to laugh of his curiosity but I can tell everyone in the room has questions, especially me. Why didn’t I die?
