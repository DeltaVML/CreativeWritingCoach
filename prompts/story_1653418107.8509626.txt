STORY:
================================

Maria eyed off the distance, trying to materialise a figure to Sophia's question. 
'I've lost count, well into the hundreds.'

Sophia nodded, sipping her gin and tonic. She could see it, a beautiful older woman such as her would still be popular with gentleman. Hell, even younger men would want to tussle with her. 

'So no figure, but surely some memorable ones?' 

'Oh yes, but not for the reasons you may think. I recall one in particular. I'd just finished a man off when his wife walked in.'

Sophia's eyes widened. 'No way! What'd you do?'

'What do you think? Did the same to her then left.'

Sophia loved that she'd swing both ways.

'Guess that marriage didn't last.' 

'Ended quicker than I finished him off.' 

They shared a laugh, Sophia still admiring Maria's graceful aging. 

'I've ended a few marriages too. Caught in the act in hot tubs, hotel rooms, the marital bedrooms.'

'And you're still not in jail?' Maria now the one in shock. 'That's sloppy work. You want to be in this business as long as I have you'll need to finesse your skills.'

'I guess nobody wants to air their dirty laundry. Besides, I don't mind it sloppy.' Remarked Sophia with a sly wink.

'Each to their own I suppose.' 

They clinked glasses downed their drinks and went about their not so dissimilar lives, given they both finished people off, in their own style.
