STORY:
================================

The gods watched as the mushroom clouds plumed through the earth’s atmosphere, they covered nearly all visible land. 

“Such a shame, thousands of years of prophecies predicting their demise, only to simply do it to themselves,” spoke the god of life. 

“At least it is time too build something anew,” claimed the god of the inanimate.

“Enough commentary now, bring the chosen one before us,” the god king requested. 

In life, he was merely a greasy, overweight, mostly insignificant neckbeard. However, his skill at the real time strategy, and the turn based strategy genre were unrivalled. On top of that, he had many thousands of hours experience as an armchair military tactician on Reddit. 

The pantheon was an epic sized platform, appearing to rest calmly in the cosmos, with the dying Earth in the background. Still there, the god of life and the inanimate stood waiting with the many others for the newcomer. 

Floating as if a gargantuan balloon towards the centre of the pantheon, the prospect was viewed and judged by the crowd of gods. 

After staring up and down this new prospect, the god of love exclaimed “Surely a virgin shouldn’t be the new god?!” and snickered lightly.

Trying to identify muscle in the body of the soul, the god of gains observed “He must have never worshipped me.”

“Enough criticisms, nobody here can match this man’s strategic genius,” Asserted the god king. 

He was now at the centre, before the god king. An urge to kneel overcame him, except he never properly learnt how, it always ending in a tumble. Hopefully he was not asked too next. 

“This is now the god of war,” the god king proclaimed. 

There was some surprise among the crowd, but most audibly was expectedly the previous god of war, “You have finally found someone more capable than me? I conquered entire galaxies before I ended up here!” 

“Yes, it is done,” replied the god king as the Earth could still be seen smouldering.

He knew he was good at strategy games, and spent many hours on Reddit, but everyone always said was an idiot there..
