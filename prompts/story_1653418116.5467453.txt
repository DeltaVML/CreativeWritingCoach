STORY:

You know, I hadn't noticed how much she manipulated me into doing these things.

The way she looked at me with a big innocent smile, how she laughed as she walked through the field of dandelions. I watched the old whispers of forgotten and untold wishes drift past her, and I couldn't help but think of what creatures were crushed underneath her feet. The littlest of bugs, the tiniest springtails and ants in tandem with a scatter of butterfly wings that tried to escape the net; all tried to run from my daughter.

And then there was me.

The most despised thing a bug could witness.

If a bug could dream, it could never fathom what I did to them.

An invisible prison was combined with a poison that quickly drifted into its book-lungs along with a frozen chamber, dark and cold to lull any being to eternal sleep. A gentle nudge into a foul tube full of what looked like water, or even worse, a crucifixion upon my walls.

And I had many of them.

So many tiny bugs that were crucified, arms splayed to embrace the skies, to be watched and observed by unknown beings that couldn't be understood by even the simplest of minds.

But that was just my job.
