STORY:
================================

Here's my story!! Beware, it's longnand incredibly rushed so, if there's any mistakes, don't throw a potchfork at me for it!

—

You look around to your left, and then to right to see the thousands of other humans starting right before you, guarded by one large electronic screen. Three minutes? Hmph. Surely that wasn’t even time to shower, let alone think.

By now, many people, women, men, children, anyone of all ages started to cry. And shout, and scream. Whatever you all could let out of this hellhole situation. You were all helpless, no one to turn to but yourselves.

The bit of humanity left had fate lying right beneath their feet, and soon, chatter started piling up after the robot concluded its statement. “SILENCE!” It’s voice roared through the whole city. The robot’s voice was so loud, it bounced off into the clouds, and onto your ears like they were mosquitoes, biting you away until death. “If none of you are to speak, there’s no point in sparing your pitiful, mortal lives.”

“One minute remaining.” The AI reminds us once again.

You all look at each other in distraught. 'None of us are that smart to think of anything. Some of us are even throwing things at the computer screen in an attempt to remove AI. Commotion is at its peak, and no one knows what to do.' You think.

You sigh, knowing you have to at least try and fight, even if you lose. You speak up and declare your voice as loud as it can go, “If you spare us, we could continue reproducing and making this Earth last as long as possible.” As soon as you start speaking, the crowd pulls apart from you so the robot can see only you.

Everyone’s attention is drawn to you now, you start sweating out of shyness. Nevertheless, you continue. “And, in benefit of you, Artificial Intelligence, we can make mends to improve technology so maybe you’ll have a world of your own; and you won’t bother us, and we won’t bother you.” You finally say.

It starts out slow, but a series of claps from many different people, applauding your bravery and skill to be this courageous at a time like this. Good things always come to end though, eh? The claps are stopped by the robot voice. It seems like its trying to say something at first, but the AI lets out a “ha ha,” laughing at you, at all of you.

AI grabs you with its metal, slinky robotic hands, and pulls you to the center. “What if, hm, I just enslave all of you and make you all work for me? That would be easier than just creating another universe, it would probably take…. approximately between 100 and 1,000 years to come, so why bother?”

And as if fate had humor, it continues, “And what is SO important about living your mortal lives if your just gonna die anyway? We, robots, will be here forever. We are immortal.”

You let out a deep sigh. The robot was right, what was important about being human? Everything was always ruined one way or another. Why did you even try? No, scratch that. At least you did what you could.

You look to your side, you see your wife, face as pale as chalk, holding your child. She looks at you and whispers, "what are we going to do, Mark? There's no hope left for humanity." Your son looks at you with the most precious eyes and holds his mother's hand tightly. He buries his face into her chest, "I don't want to die," he sobs.

You suddenly feel empty inside. Your wife and kids, how could you forget about them? This whole situation was so hard to wrap around one's head that you'd completely forgotten about your own family. 

You were worried about whether or not humanity would survive in general, but you care about them too. There's no way we've built generations upon generations just to have it taken away, right? Generations? That was it! It was the perfect reason why AI spares humans.

"We may not live very long, but our future generations will. Yes, you may live longer, however, it doesn't mean you can spread your genes like we can. A robot cannot create babies. As long as we keep our DNA in our bloodline, humans will prosper with the right actions." You finally say to the robot, your heart beating dramatically.
