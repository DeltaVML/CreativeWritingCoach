I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I stared in awe as he lit his cigarette and took a long drag while the elevator descended at nearly free fall to the moon's core. 

"Eh, fuck it. If I die, I die." He mumbled through a breath of smoke, shrugging. 

Not all of them were like this. Humans I mean. Lots that I've met were perfectly fearful beings. The younger ones born within our colony especially!

But, some of these 'outers,' humans born on the astroid rim far from safety? They're different. 

The elevator shakes dramatically as we approach. My heart is racing. I won't even see a Diggit but knowing they're so close is unbearable. The claws, the stone skin, the multiple mouths and teeth with hunks of their prey still hanging between. 

Just then he sighs and checks his spare ammo mags. "Here we go again. Think there's gonna be as many big ones this time?"

Swallow hard, My throat is too dry. "I don't know, but, but thank you..."

He smiled, almost like it was an absurd thing, me thanking him for fighting to keep the moon safe, like it was just another day for him. He just nodded contently. 

I look at the control panel. We'll arrive in thirty seconds. 

"FUCK FUCK FUCK YOU PIECE OF SHIT LEGGY CUNT!!!!!" 

Three loud bangs behind me and I jump almost to the ceiling. Turning around, there he is, with the butt of his rifle on the ground between us, panting. 

Between breaths he shakily starts, "Spider. I got it. Fucking HATE spiders" he growls through a grimace with one final shiver. Moving the rifle, I see his foe, now a smudge on the floor no bigger than a pencil eraser. 

ding.

We're here, and just like that: he's good again. Smiling from behind a cigarette. 
 
The self-preservation must be broken in this one.
