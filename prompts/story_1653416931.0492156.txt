STORY:
================================

"I don't understand. You say there are no laws preventing you from sharing technology or scientific data."

"Correct."

"But you still won't do so."

"Also correct. We do not wish to be responsible for the annihilation of a whole race!"

"Do you believe us to be that careless? That we would destroy ourselves so easily?"

"Not careless, but of course it would destroy you. Well, most of you. Your offspring go through a...pre- verbal stage, yes? They might survive."

There was a long pause as the human ambassador tried to digest this information and form a coherent response. "How would they survive? Anything that would cause my death would surely also kill a child."

Another long pause, this time from the Tyrrpol ambassador. "I apologize, we did not realize your offspring became &lt;&lt;frrek&gt;&gt; so young."

"What? Something didn't translate. Become what?"

"&lt;&lt;Frrek&gt;&gt;, um....solid? Set? Our offspring can accept new information without risk of death for around 2 of your years. We thought the timetable would be similar for you."

"Risk of...ambassador humans can accept new information at any point in their lifespan. Some might refuse, but there is no risk of injury or death."

"No. No no no no NO NO NO NO NO."

The Tyrrpol ambassador was still screaming when his neural net lost coherence.
