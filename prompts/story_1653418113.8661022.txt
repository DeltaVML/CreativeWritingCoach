STORY:

“I promised to never use it again.”

Ject stared at the shot glass on the table, its contents half full of a thick burnt sienna liquor. He dipped his pinkie in it, licked it clean and pushed the drink away.

“I don’t drink. I don’t do magick. And I DON’T cast spells. You’re wasting your time.”

The five head mages of the five continents stared at him with exactly the same expression: one of marked disgust.

Ject inwardly laughed. Their hatred and fear of him was probably the only thing they agreed on.

“Listen here,” one round and silky robes wizard shouted, stuffing his fat finger into Ject’s face, “we lived with the results of your fatal mistake, so you owe us. Now get out of this hovel and get to the Quarter!”

Ject sighed as the four other wizards held back the flailing fop of a spell-caster. Sir Wiggins was only assigned as North Outland leader due to his connections and aptitude for collecting favors. He wasn’t a particularly skilled wizard, but he was one with a lot of connections. Ject couldn’t really afford to piss him off, but this was one rule he couldn’t break.

“You’re right,” Ject spoke, his long tousled black hair falling past his shoulders and onto the table as he leaned forward, “I do owe you. I can help you in any other way. Whatever resources you need from the Inlands, I can get. But I won’t risk the Blemish again.”

“But Ject, “ a spindly dark skinned wizard from south Outland stuttered,“ the B..Blemish is returning. We thought the land was finally healing, but now c..cases are cropping up across the land.”

A beautiful blonde wizard from the Outskirts raised her hand. Her voice was gentle, yet authoritative as she spoke.
“It’s even reached into my chief village, Ephesian. My people have had to flee. Our mana is not strong enough to stop its spread.”

Ject paused, eyeing the woman he had once called his wife. Her long blonde hair and dark makeup were as alluring now as they had once been, but the sting of words past spoken besmirched her enticing appearance.

“I owe no allegiance to your lands, Sevena. My ties with the Outskirts died with the rest of the continents many centuries ago.”

“You’re a fool!” Severa yelled, slapping Ject across the face, “the Blemish will come for us all! And that includes you.”

Ject said nothing, his hand feeling the heat rise on his right cheek.

Twins brothers with hair red as blood, the holders of the remaining two continents, stepped forward.

“I find seeking you both troublesome and necessary,” the one bearing the crest of Paradise murmured, “but necessity trumps comfort. We need your help.”

“And we are willing to risk everything,” the one bearing the crest of Ministration projected, his thoughts beaming into their brains simultaneously.

“Okay, then,” Ject said, slamming down an empty glass, “just to get some peace and quiet, I’ll do it.”
