STORY:

Contrary to popular belief, not all demons are hell bent on spreading pain and suffering. Some lesser demons don't fancy it all even. Hell, it's a little, different from the surface world. You have your power tripping middle management except you can't just quit your job down here. No, it's a long exhausting process when you factor in eternity. You see time works differently, so much so that it's pretty much non-existent. But goddammit is the boredom as real as it can be. They use that shit against you in a fashion you quite literally cannot fathom. Needless to say, many demons don't have a choice but to meet their quota of what you probably know as possessions. I've watched just about every possession movie you humans have put out, huge fan. While their are some that get fairly close, none of them correctly depict how the possessions progress from infection to death and/or extraction. 

I can almost guarantee you've come acrossed someone possessed by one of these types of demons or you yourself were being controlled by one. Think back, most of you would have experienced this as a kid. Remember when your brother or sister, maybe even a cousin or a friend, randomly decided to steal something? For no particular reason at all, they just felt like it. Never had they stolen something before. That was a lessor. Just trying to fill their quota as easy and quickly as possible. 

Like in the films, children are some of the easiest hosts to overcome. Except it's not because they are weak. Not at all, infact it's the opposite. Unbeknownst to human kind the spirit of a child is usually impossibly fortified. That's their downside. Their spirit knows this and it's too trusting because it feels itself impenetrable. That's how we get in. We show a friendly face and the doorknob turns. Drinking between friends also provides a relatively easy crack to slip through. We get those idiots to do dumbshit all the time. "Hey bro, hold my beer. I'm gunna ram this golf cart into that tree." These lessors figured they could fill their quota without causing too much damage. They figured what could go wrong, you know? Middle management really never cared because quotas were being filled and it was less of a headache to just leave it be. It was good. 

I'm running out of time here, I'll start getting to the point. A couple of your centuries ago, we got this newbie. Top of their class in our most prestigious demon academy. All we've heard since they arrived is how naturally talented they are and how they could rival the big man himself with some gidden ace up his sleeve. Straight up brown nosing son of a bitch I tell you. He caught on to the lessors' scheme and turned it against them. Against us. There are far worse fates than death. Some worse than spending an eternity in hell even. To avoid the unthinkable, some of us started doing the unthinkable.

You see, some of you, are not who you think you are. We found a way to intertwine our being, with that of a humans. Not a mear possession but a complete take over. We gain all their memories, their tastes although sometimes they don't always stick quite right and you... we, remember something differently or suddenly don't like the taste of something previously savored. The downside is we lose ourselves. We do not keep our memories. We keep almost nothing of our former selves.
You have to realize that your friend, Murphy, isn't actually your friend. You don't remember anything about them before they asked you, "What could go wrong?" Or "Hold my beer." Murphy caught on to us again and he is continuing what he started. He wants to infect all of us to build his army. There's a war being fought in hell, and we are losing. That's why I need you to remember. I NEED YOU TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM MURPHY.
