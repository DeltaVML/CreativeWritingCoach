I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

As I waited in my cell, i couldn’t believe how bright and comfortable it was. Probably a special cell for death row inmates. I knew the gruesome reality of our prisons. Perhaps they can keep a handfull of them clean because their occupants don’t stay there long enough.

I heard a knock on the door. 

"Yes ?" I answered 

"The queen would like to talk to you"

"Ok, whatever"

The top half of the door opened, revealing the queen standing behind the bars.

"May I ask what do you think motivates my visit ?" She asked

"I don’t know, torture ?"

"No" she said sternly, "what do you think you’re doing here"

"Because you don’t like my ideals"

"It’s not about ideals, *you killed an man*. Could you please justify yourself ?"

"Well he wasn’t really a man, he was a pawn of your ruthless regime, violently oppressing my comrades. I had to do what i could to save them"

"Don’t you think that *man* or rather *policeman* was a tiny bit justified in stopping you and your friends from throwing molotov cocktails at a reeducation center ?"

"Ha ! Reeducation, more like indoctrination ! I see you extend your rule. Overturn freedoms one by one. Bit by bit tearing our country from inside. Stealing the wealth from the poors only to throw lavish parties with your friends. We don’t want you, we want Revolution ! We want freedom ! We want democracy ! Enough is enough !"

"If it is like you say, how come the royal budget is capped anually by a vote of the people ? How come we are stealing from the poor when our GINI coefficient is decreasing year by year ? Are you sure about your sources ?"

"All of that is made up nonsense ! You are lying ! Your government is lying ! Your medias are lying ! 

About a year ago, through a comment on Facebook I learned how we’ve been lied to about the so called ‘dictator’ Kanilil Balinov. I learned all my life of how evil he was. But i saw a video, saw how happy the people were there, and how we aren’t here. I don’t trust you anymore, i know i will get sentenced to death, but i hope i won’t die in vain. That my actions inspired others, and that with brother Kanilil we will make a better world"

"Sentenced to death ???" She couldn’t hold her laughter. "It has been abolished for the past 50 years !

You will face your trial tomorrow, you can have legal help from anyone of your choosing, and we can also arrange a licenced professional to talk with you beforehand. It is your right after all. 

I don’t want to influence tomorrow’s judgment, but i find it sad that people believe propaganda videos on internet and never bother to check with reality. It is tragic that a man had to die from this."
