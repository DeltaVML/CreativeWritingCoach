AITA for destroying a universe?

Now, before you start judging, let me explain.

So I was doing my thing, being the god of darkness and destruction and all that, when I came across a universe that was filled with mortal life forms. Now, I despise mortal life forms, and this universe’s dominant ones in particular were… not very smart, to say the least. They were not good at keeping their energy-creating processes eco-friendly, wiping out the populations of inhabited planets within a decade of landing on them. By the time I noticed them, they’d eliminated all life forms on all the planets of at least half of their universe’s galaxies. I’d usually enjoy watching that kinda stuff happen, but even I found it stupid how they did absolutely nothing to stop it; heck, it didn’t seem like they cared or even noticed it at all. So I figured I’d… give them a hand, as the best way to put it would be. I moseyed on over to their universe, kinda just made a Big Crunch happen, and… bloop. Universe destroyed.

Of course, the goddess of light and creation got super mad at me, saying how “you should’ve given them a chance”, “allowed me to handle them”, “I’d kick you off the Divine Council if I could”, blah blah blah. I know the next Divine Council meeting, which is coming up in just a few weeks, won’t go down so well, so I figured I’d get some advice from you mortals on what to do.

AITA?
