STORY:

I hear a knock at my door. I know better than to answer it. I turn back to the advertisement I’m getting paid to edit, trying without success to ignore the desperate pounding on my door. I blast music, and that helps for a while, but it doesn’t stop me from noticing the thin white envelope sliding under my door. I turn off my music. The knocking has stopped, but there’s no doubt in my mind they’re still sitting there, hoping I will answer. They will sit in that same spot until they grow so weak with exhaustion or hunger or both that all they can do is limply drag their ravaged body towards their apartment. I’m just glad it’s only one this time. Sometimes they come by the dozens, a plethora of wanting fingers prickling in anticipation for my response. 


  
After a short length of time, I hear them walk away, and my body involuntarily shudders in relief. That was a short one, and now I can focus again. Now I can exist without the fear that always comes with each visit. But the silence doesn’t last forever. Soon the footsteps return. Confusion blankets my mind until it is cut short by the swing of an ax through my door. They’ve never gone this far before, but I am prepared. I run to my bedroom, my shaking fingers slipping on the knob. I find my shotgun on the bedside table, then I lock the door to my bedroom, run into my closet, and lock that door, too. The thud of metal on wood reverberates throughout the apartment as I wait. Time does not exist, it is moving so painfully slow. Eventually the thudding stops and I know they have made it through the first door. There is a brief intermittence before I hear the thudding again, much closer this time. It doesn’t take them as long to get through this door, and my fingers whiten around the gun’s cool barrel. Now the ax head is inches away from my face every time it makes a blow, so I press my back into the wall of the closet and obscure my face with clothing. It’s been three years since I saw another human face, and the bottomless pit of my stomach doesn’t seem too happy about it. The ax stops, and the door creaks open. Hands slowly pull away the clothes in front of me, my last layer of protection, and the gun slips free of my fingers, landing with a metallic thud on the closet floor. 


  
It’s worse than I could have imagined. 


  
It’s my ex-boyfriend, the first person to hunt me down. The last person I’d ever want to hurt. The reason I’m locked away in the first place. Tears cascade down my cheeks as I look into his amber eyes, a face so familiar and comforting that it burns to know what he must do. He leans down and places a hand on either side of my face just like he used to do every morning to wake me up. 


  
“Please please please please don’t.” My voice comes out in a broken whimper, but he doesn’t seem to notice. Instead he pulls my face up to his and kisses me like our faces were always meant to be one. And my world collapses.
