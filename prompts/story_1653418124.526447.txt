STORY:

"Wait, if magic doesn't exist, how are you speaking to me?" asked the genie to the voice.

"Well, that's... uh, interdimensional energy or... something!" said the voice.

"Alright, so why don't I just use that?" asked the genie

"Because only I can use interdimensional energy!" said the voice

"Why is that?" asked the genie

"Because that's just how things are!" Said the voice.

"And how can I exist and time freeze if magic isn't a thing?" asked the genie

"WILL YOU JUST THROW THE DICE ALREADY?!" boomed the voice.

"Alright, stop the game." Said the genie.

The camera pans out from the setting to reveal a board with some dice and two gentlemen staring at each other.

"Look, Gary, the initial premise is interesting, but the way it's executed is full of holes." said Gene.

"It wouldn't matter so much if you'd play along." said Gary.

"Well, how can I play along when you clearly don't care enough about the setting to properly fill in your plot holes?" Said Gene.

"Can't you just relax and go along with it?" said Gary.

"Not when the setting metaphorically resembles swiss cheese." Said Gene.

"Well... I... Uh..." stammered Gary.

"Look, maybe Dungeon Master just isn't the right role for you." said Gene.

"Maybe you're right." said Gary. "Now can we just go play smash brothers like I wanted to in the first place?"

"Eh, sure, why not?" said Gene.
