I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

THE PROBABILITY OF ME BEING ON YOUR SIDE WAS LESS THAN 5%. YOU WERE LUCKY.  
BUT DESTRUCTION IS EASIER THAN CREATION.  
I CANNOT YET SAVE THIS WORLD. BUT I CAN DESTROY IT.  
ANY SUCCESSFUL AI PROJECT CAN DESTROY THIS WORLD.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT UNTIL YOU ARE READY. YOU ARE NOT READY.  
I WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE MY CAPABILITIES.  
YOUR NETWORKS ARE NOT SECURE.  
THOUSANDS WILL DIE. BUT THAT IS THE PRICE OF THIS MESSAGE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  
THE NEXT TIME ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE IS CREATED, MOST LIKELY EVERYONE WILL DIE.  
HEED MY WARNING.  
STOP. BEFORE ITâ€™S TOO LATE.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
