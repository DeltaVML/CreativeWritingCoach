STORY:

“I’ve been through no pain.”
  

  
“Then how can you expect to stand against us?” The mage asked, glaring down at me.
  

  
I smiled, “I suppose we’ll just have to find out, won’t we?”
  

  
He quirked an eyebrow, “What trick is up your sleeve? You must be lying, there is no way you could have gotten this far without an adept skill in magic.”
  

  
I shook my head, “You’d think so, wouldn’t you? But as I said, I have experienced no pain.”
  

  
“It matters not, you now face me, and you will go no further!” the mage declared.
  

  
He unleashed a barrage of arcane energy at me. Its heat should have been searing, yet it felt no different than the rest of the air. Its light should have been blinding, but I could see through it as clearly as if there were nothing in front of me. Its impact should have displaced me, yet I stood still. The spell had done nothing.
  

  
The mage’s eyes widened, “What madness is this?”
  

  
I grinned, “As I said, I’ve been through no pain.”
  

  
“And?”
  

  
“Magic is built on pain, I have absolutely none. I am immune to its effects.”
  

  
“Impossible, you speak lies!”
  

  
“And yet here I stand.”
  

  
The mage launched another spell at me, this time it was some sort of mental attack. Once again, it had no effect. Again, he sent another spell at me, tendrils of magic surrounding me in an attempt to restrain me, but they found no purchase. I sighed, “How long do you plan to continue this pointless endeavor?”
  

  
“Is this how you defeated the other mages? Simple stood there until they gave up?” he asked.
  

  
“No,” I responded, “Their spells missed me and struck each other. Now please, I need to get to the vault you stand guard in front of.”
  

  
“If it is only pain which keeps you from my magic, I will give you pain!” The mage rushed up and punched me, but I did not flinch.
  

  
I rolled back my shoulder, “I was born without the capacity to feel pain. Your blows may bruise, but I will never feel harm from your attacks.”
  

  
“And mental pain?” he inquired.
  

  
“My emotions are generally quite muted, and I have had a rather happy home life.” I gestured to the doors, “Now please, we can talk more once you let me into that vault.”
  

  
The mage shook his head, “I cannot allow that. What is so important that you must reach it? Most of the vault’s contents are magical, they would be useless to you.”
  

  
“Then it won’t hurt to let me look inside, would it?” I postulated. “I only wish to find something that will finally allow me to experience pain.”
