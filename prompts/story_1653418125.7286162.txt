STORY:

"That's impossible, Two," Operator One whispered in hushed tones. "There's only three Operators with edit access."

"I thought the same 'till an hour ago," Operator Two replied. "One, take a look at this."

The duo stood in a nondescript park, littered with trees and paths and greenery. Two pointed towards the nearest tree. "The tree bark," she said. "Take a look."

One stared at the tree for a few moments before replying, "That's… not tree bark. Wait, is it moving?" The not-bark was indeed moving; like syrup, it was melting down the sides of the tree in a gradual advance towards the ground.

"It gets weirder," Two continued. She glanced round to check for humans then snapped her fingers. At once, a holo-display appeared in front of them. "Search for known glitches in the logs."

One looked confused as he concentrated on the display. The holo-display responded to the unspoken query with a short list. "Few thousand," One muttered. "But that's harmless. They're all visual glitches. We patched out anything dangerous eons ago."

"Search again," Two replied, "But not for glitches. Look for anything similar to the tree."

"Right…" One said. He looked at the tree and closed his eyes. Opening them, he gasped as he looked at the list on the display. 

"What the fuck?" One cried. "8.6 Quintillion?!" 

Two looked haggard as she responded, "Yeah. I know."

"Why haven't you told Three?" 

"You know what they're like. They'll get mad and blame me. You've got more experience so I asked you first. And I-" Two sighed. "I don't know what's happening."

One looked as if he was about to pass out. "You don't know. You don't know why 8.6 quintillion edits were made and none of them were recorded as glitches?" 

"No."

One let out a sigh. "Let's take a closer look."

The Operators walked up to the tree and One peered at it with a discerning eye. "This looks like something I'd make when I was new to the job," he said. "It's poor work. I'd have failed a trainee Operator in an instant for it."

Two suppressed a smile. "Like the time I sent that meteor towards Earth by accident?" 

One rolled his eyes. "Ugh. Don't remind me. That incident paperwork took weeks to file." He hovered a hand over the melting tree. "Why show me this edit in particular?" 

"It's the first one made," Two replied. "And as you said, it's bad. Figured whoever did this was sloppy. Left clues. Right?"

"Good thinking," One said. He brought the holo-display over to him with the flick of a hand. "Edit author," He muttered to himself, "Authorisation level, counter-signer and date of-what?" 

Two glanced over. "What?" 

"It's one author. All of the edits are from one author."

Two blinked. "Impossible."

One was now frantically checking logs and making secondary searches. "There's no way. Oh- oh. This is bad. Real bad." He looked up at Two, fear evident in his eyes. "We need to leave."

"What? Why?" 

"It's not an Operator doing this."

"Then who?" Two asked. 

"It's a human."

Suddenly, the holo-display in front of Two duplicated itself. Then again to make four; then again and again and again, until there was a wall of screens stretching into the sky and as far as the eye could see.

"Too late," a tinny voice echoed from the original display. 

A woman had appeared on the display, grinning at the Operators with eyes like black holes; her lips curled back further to reveal an impossible number of teeth. One by one, each screen became static then was replaced by the same grinning woman. 

"Well, that was easy. I knew whoever created all this'd investigate. Found you," she hissed.

"Run!" One shouted. He grabbed at Two's hand and dragged her back from the spectacle of screens.

Then, everything was plunged into darkness as the sun in the sky disappeared.
