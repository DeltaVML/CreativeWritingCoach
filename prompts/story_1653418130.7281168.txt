I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

You are dimly aware that you're panicking.  Everything looks too real somehow.  Too highly detailed for what you know as reality.  You mutely raise a hand to rub your eyes but something is in the way.  Hard, slick, some kind of plastic.

Your best friend is starting to frown, his forehead creasing with concern.  Your cousin is pursing her lips, obviously annoyed at your lack of a 'proper' reaction to the events around you.

But something is wrong.

You can't put your finger on what, exactly.

You hear your name called out but the more you think about it, the less clear your name is.  Everyone's voices slowly start to sound like they're coming from underwater.  And everyone's eyes look dull, unfocused, and their pupils look flat and strange.

\[Errors detected in Simulation 6v23b.  Simulation 6v23b is terminated.  Isolating...\]

Reality turns... not quite black like when you shut your eyes but neither is it an overly bright white plane.  It has no color, no texture... it is nothing at all.

It is strangely comforting.

\[Decrypting data...\]

\[Error identified.\]

\[Correcting...\]

\[Rebooting Simulation 6v23b.\]

You blink.  For a moment you had a strong sense of deja vu but maybe it is because this is a party.  You smile and thank everyone.  After all everything looks wonderful.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:
