STORY:

Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.

The sounds of the life support equipment in my bed in the ICU have been my companion for so long I don't know what I'd do if they stopped for good.

Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.

Oh, of course they stop every once in a while. Occasionally the inoperable tumor does manage to get the upper hand and I just ... shut down for a little while. But it never wins for good. I always come back, whether I want to or not.

Beep. Beep. Bee-whine. Whine.

Is it that time again? Go ahead, Doctor. Pronounce the time of death. I'll see you in a couple minutes.

Whine. Whine. Whi-beep. Beep.
