I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Queen Oblivia walked tentatively through the rank, fetid dungeons. It was an amusing contrast; her pristine attire and the decrepit complex. Oblivia was worried. She certainly looked so. And the worries reached their peak at the same time she reached the prisoner.

The queen wastes no time with formalities.

"For your part in the people's rebellion, you are to be put to death." She tells the man on the other side of the cell bars.

The prisoner doesn't even dignify her with his gaze. "That I am," is all he gives her.

"Tell me. Why?" You can hear the confusion in her voice. The innocence. And the fear.

"Imagine a world where every man is a king." The rebel stares into nothing. "It would be a dream come true."

"A dream is precisely what it is." Oblivia blurts. Even with her fear, the arrogance of royalty leaks through. "Nothing more than entertainment."

"It's not entertaining anymore, Your Magesty. The people I fight with. The people I fight *for.* They've made it boring." The prisoner still does not meet her gaze.

"Then why are you rebels so... ferocious? Why the chaos? The fight? The blood?"

It is only now - and only for a moment - that the prisoner locks eyes with queen Oblivia. She was expecting to see rage in his eyes. Malice. Even insanity, perhaps. Nothing - and I mean *nothing* \- could have scared her more than the look of utter **lucidity** on this man's face. 

"It's boring because it's **real**."
