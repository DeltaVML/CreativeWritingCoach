STORY:
================================

The sky turned purple, then faded to a brilliant orange, back to a cloudy gray day. The world below reflected the different colors of the sky as it phased through them. Now a Chartreuse, a red, now green. 

A man in a bowtie sprints down the street, coattails flapping in his wake as he ran back through an alley. A smart, short woman with red hair followed, wearing what looked to be a Bobby outfit. They made it to a large blue Police Box looking uncharacteristic against the scrummy-looking alley. 

The man wrenched open the door and instead of there being a Policeman sitting on a chair there was a huge room. In the center was a large copper control panel with more bits and bobs and knobs and other things that would make even a airplane pilot scratch his head at. But this man, knew. 

"What did you do this time?" The redhead said between gasps. "Why is the sky like that."

The man in the bowtie grimaced. "I don't know."

"YOU'RE The Doctor, you're supposed to know." She reached over the console and braced herself on the ledge.

"Just because I'm The DOCTOR doesn't mean I know everything, Clara. It's not the Daleks, it's not the Cybermen, it's not the Silence, hell it's not even Drax having a good day. I don't know what this is and it's angry." 

The Doctor fiddled with a few more controls and the usual \*vorp vorp\* sound happened while the box seemed to fade in and out of existence. soon the only reminder that it had been in the alley was a few newspapers fluttering in the wind and a scared alley cat knocking over a random trash can. 

Meanwhile back in the Box the Doctor was flipping through a few more controls. "It seems almost like there's a disruption across all of time. And it's a broadcast signal. I don't get it. Like background radiation. It's everywhere, bloody everywhere and if I could just deduce the signal we could find out what it's broadcasting."

"You're telling me the TARDIS can't even pick this up?" The girls' eyebrows furrowed together. The TARDIS was better than that. It regularly played channels all the time. It had a love of 1960's-era Saturday Morning Cartoons. 

"Sure it can." He said. "It's just... It seems to be part of everything."

Flustered, Clara yanked the monitor out of one of the Doctor's hands and hit the side of it. The picture went diagonal for a second, then a faint line appeared. She hit it a second time and this time the line expanded out to show a fuzzy picture of something. It didn't look humanoid like many aliens did, which surprised the Doctor. 

Clara gave a self-satisfactory nod and crossed her arms, "Just like the old telly my dad tried to fix ages ago. Sometimes yah got to hit it right to make the picture come out right."

There was a split second before the universal translator could pick up the signal and transmit more than static. Then it flipped over. 

"You!" It said. "I have finally found YOU. The cause of all my troubles! Stop breaking things! The entire simulation is broken, you've done broken it."

"I wot?" The Doctor said he cocked his head and scratched at it, then smoothed his hair back which only made him look more like a frightened ostrich. "I don't have the faintest idea of what you are talking about."

"You broke my simulation! All fizzing about in that space ship of yours."

"I'll have you know the TARDIS is more than just a space ship-" The doctor interrupted.

"But you do the impossible things! Making people appear and disappear at times they're not supposed to be. You've angered quite a few people. Caused a few rifts in time. Then there was this whole time war thing. It wasn't supposed to happen like that."

Clara realized that this particular being sounded like one of her students when one of their maths equations goes awry and they don't quite know how they got to the result they got. The easiest thing, she'd always tell them, is to work backwards until you find out where your mistake was. 

"So we have the Doctor who apparently changed the simulation." Clara said talking over the being's worrying. "That's where we are now. Right? The question isn't do we fix it, but how did this happen so we can fix it."

The being started speaking some kind of mechanical jargon. Clara didn't understand it and by the side eye the Doctor was giving her, he didn't understand either. 

"We're kind of babies when it comes to, well,  whatever it is you're talking about. Give us an explanation like we're two years old." The Doctor stated. This was his expertise, speaking things in a timey-wimey kind of way they can understand. 

"So, like, some of the temporal things you do are illogical and kind of mess with the... flow of time... It's the simplest way to explain that part. I don't know why it's messed up. Like... Like a computer on the fritz, all smoking and stuff. It was working fiiine but then it stopped!" Their voice started going up an octave. 

"Okay, okay." Clara said, getting closer to the monitor. "It's okay."

"It's not okay! This was the biggest projec
