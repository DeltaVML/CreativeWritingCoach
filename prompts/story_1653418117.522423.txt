STORY:
================================

I've been staring at the whiteboard for months.  It made sense but, it didn't.  I looked at the equation, the equation accepted by everyone on the planet but, it looked, askew.  Twisted.  Wrong.  It looked like those whiteboards you see in movies and TV shows but this one had pictographs.  Apples.  Apples everywhere.  The accepted answer of 4 was considered "the answer".  2 apples, combined with 2 apples, is 4 apples.  What if...

I got up and wiped the 4 off.  I picked up the temporary marker and wrote 7.  What if 2 plus 2 was actually 7.

The marker squeaks as I finish the downstroke.  Then a loud swoosh sound behind me.  I quickly turn around and a dark figure walks through the door.  "Mr. Corn I presume?" he says in a raspy but squeaky voice.  "It's been thousands of years, since the Egyptians, but no one is supposed to possess this knowledge", he continues.  I couldn't make out who this figure was or, hell, what it was, but it had a faint familiarity with it.

I quickly reached for the flashlight but it hits the wall and the dark figure chases after it.  I move it again and the figure runs after it again.  It was, i don't know, chasing it.  "Who are you?  What... what are you?".  "I am the buffer between the knowledge you seek, the knowledge you just uncovered, and a tear in reality" as it removed its hood, I saw a white nose, brown face, fur, pointed ears.  I murmured the words "Who... what are you?".  Now fully exposed, it replied "They call me... Mr. Cheeks".

"A FUCKING HAMSTER!?  What does this have to do with a tear in fucking reality?  Kids get math wrong all the time and put 2 plus 2 is 7.  Do you VISIT ALL OF THEM!?".  It turned, "You figured it out, but, you're still blind.  You can't get off the exercise wheel that is societal norms yet.  You see it though, don't you.  The unwritten numbers.  Maybe you don't see them but, you feel them."  I walked to the couch, "I must have slipped and hit my head.  None of this makes sense".  "YES!", Mr. Cheeks exclaimed "None of it makes sense.  No one takes apples.  No one takes oranges.  When you do subtraction, you're not giving Stacy 4 apples, you're giving her, nothing".  

As the word "nothing" came out of his mouth in that high squeaky voice, my surroundings started to fade.  The desk, the lamp, the couch I was just on, all dematerializing.  He looked at me again with a smile, "It's always... about the apples".
