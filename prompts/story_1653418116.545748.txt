STORY:

I reach into the nest and grab the animals young, I smash its weak form into my desk, before pouring it's guts into a bowl.

The young dealt with, I go after it's mother; ripping free her skin, I expertly slice the flesh apart, revelling in the perfect slices that I rip free.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, the ultimate disrespect. I drop the lacerated flesh into the remains of her child, making sure they're well combined. I finish my fell combinations, with a scattering of charred oats, before throwing everything into a fire.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, at last, my chicken strips will be complete...
