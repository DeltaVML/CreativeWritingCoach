I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I reach into the nest and grab the animals young, I smash its weak form into my desk, before pouring it's guts into a bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

The young dealt with, I go after it's mother; ripping free her skin, I expertly slice the flesh apart, revelling in the perfect slices that I rip free.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, the ultimate disrespect. I drop the lacerated flesh into the remains of her child, making sure they're well combined. I finish my fell combinations, with a scattering of charred oats, before throwing everything into a fire.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, at last, my chicken strips will be complete...

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
