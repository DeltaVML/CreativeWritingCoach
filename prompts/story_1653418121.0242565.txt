I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The memory long forgotten, yet perfectly embedded in my psyche felt like it always had been there, it just had been  cloaked to my conscious mind and then reveled to me in an instant, understanding hit me like a comet from space instantly my mind presented me with three separate states of mind at three separate points in time. I remembered my past while knowing my present and seeing my future.

I knew the mission would not be easy and would cause great disruptions to the lives of our family.
I knew the task would be a thankless one and the child would be hard to love but I knew it would be worth it in the end.
I knew that I had to help him avoid the frustrations and disappointments that could lead him to become bitter and full of hate later in life, to feel inferior and insecure in his achievements, to feel belittled and to fear mockery or disapproval. 
I knew I had to teach him to earn respect rather than demand it, how to get people to want to work towards a common goal rather than use deception, coercion and force as his means of  motivation.
What I didn't know was how I was going to manage it. 

What I didn't know was if I was going to manage it. What I really didn't know was how I came to be in this chamber of light unable to move or look away from the ball of blazing light that overwhelmed my vision yet was comfortable and soothing for my eyes.
What I didn't know was  how I was hearing the words booming around in my mind, yet could still recognise  that the room was so silent that could hear my own heartbeat and the breathing of the other people I was standing among, gathered in a circle around the glowing pulsating celestial entity that I somehow instinctively knew the ball of light to be.

I know that my mission was a success. 
I know I managed to love him.
I know that he is happy with who he is.
I know that stability and love can change who a child becomes as an adult.
I know why I was so sure I knew his new father in law from a long time ago and from the sudden shocked expression on his face a moment ago as our eyes locked I know he just remembered why he felt I was familiar too.
I know we will never talk to each other about it. 
I know I will always wonder what his child would have become. 
I know he will too.
I know he is proud too as we toast the wedding of our sons Vladimir and Donald.
I know the orphanage they run for refugee children is a loving and happy home.
I know that for there still to be a need for that home that some of the others in that room of light did not achieve their mission so well or if they did, that others had risen to fill the void of greed, hatred, bitterness, jealousy and violence.
I know we can't pin the blame for the actions of the many on just the leadership of the few.

I know the entity is returning soon.
I know we failed the test.
I know there will be consequences. 
I know our civilisation will end.
I know our civilisation is not the first chance our species has been given to look beyond this ball of rock and reach for the stars.

I hope it is not the last
