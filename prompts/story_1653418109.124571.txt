STORY:

I reached over and used my thumb to start my playlist, and as nymphetamine girl began, I let the mix of operatic and goth metal cause my body to begin to slowly relax, I reacted. I felt my muscles become smoother and time slowed down. I could suddenly see, almost like a premonition, everything that was going to happen as the pandora add played. The instant that it changed, to loco by coal chamber, time went from almost standing still, to life being in overdrive, and that's when my adrenal glands suddenly decided to kick in. No matter how hard my opponent hits me, it doesn't matter; I've never felt as alive as I have in the last two thousand years.
