STORY:
================================

"Damnit, this guy keeps going!" I thought to myself, crouched behind the half destroyed concrete wall of the building we'd been fighting in.

I'd gone into this fight with the usual Mozart pouring into my head from the bone conducting speakers in my mask.  It looked better than the airpods I'd started out with, and I was far less likely to lose an entire mask.  The classical helped me think things through, and it's amazing how often a situation can be defused by some quick thinking.

I'd immediately had to switch to my DDR playlist when I found myself dodging a swiftly thrown car moments after my arrival.  I always felt a little lacking immediately after switching to something other than classical, but I desperately needed the speed boost.  It's the only reason I survived the next few minutes of utter chaos.  I had yet to even see my opponent.  It was merely me, trying desperately to avoid the varied, insanely heavy items thrown at me in an almost constant stream.  I had never dealt with a villain with this level of strength, this level of stamina before.

"He just keeps going!" 

I moved my left thumb against the pad along my left index finger, scrolling through my various playlists.  I didn't have the time to stop and think, so classical was out.  The speed boost of DDR had gotten me to this stalemate, but no further.

"Prog? No, don't need precision.  Flamenco/tango? Footwork could help, but only if I could get in close enough."

My thoughts were interrupted as a light post appeared suddenly through the wall next to me, apparently thrown like a javelin.  He's changed his tactics, it would seem.

"Waltz? Grace won't help. House? No technology to control in this rubble. Country? I'm in the city, not a lot of animals to control nearby either."

Another lamppost speared the concrete on my other side.  He was boxing me in, it seemed.

"Oh hell, I don't have a choice!  I'm gonna have to use THIS!"

I double-tapped my thumb, finally making my selection.  The electronic music thumping through my skull cut out immediately, and in it's place a song I'd avoided at all costs started it's intro.  I felt the power slam into my body, burning through my veins.  It was intoxicating.  I was ready.  I stepped onto lamppost number three that occupied the space I had been crouched in a moment before, and from there onto the top of the wall to face my opponent.

The music coursed through me.

I threw a single fist towards what appeared to be an incredibly startled man in a mech suit with four arms, two of which are aiming yet another lamppost at my makeshift cover.  A single flash, and where his body had been was nothing.  A smoking wreckage surrounding a bloody hole where his cockpit had once been.

My headphones wailed.

"ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNCCCCHHHH..."
