I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Blood and teeth on the floor. Vinyl discs stuck from every surface. Speakers broken and my mic stand twisted. I'm out of options. 

MAX RADIUM gloats over my broken and failing body. He thinks he's won. Blind to my trembling efforts he cackles while I slip a hand to my headphones.

"Sound canceling on."

All my life, sound put power into me. My Chemical Romance summoned skeletons. Saint Motel shot light from my hands. Even little things gave momentary powers. I'd fought villain after villain with headphones thumping in my ears. The years had shown the public all of my moves. Save for one. 

Silence. and with it the strongest I can ever be. The complete absence of sound summons the power of "Unmaking".

It didn't matter that MAX RADIUM was coming to finish me off. I couldnt hear his footsteps and neither could he. Muted questions. Voiceless rage. I'm saved from a faster death by his skin starting to boil.

I stared from the floor, watching my strongest foe slow and melt. His features sagged. Bones and sinew liquified before the meat around them. He screamed. They always do. No one heard the gurgling sludge he became.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
