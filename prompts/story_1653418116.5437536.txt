STORY:

She was on the door of death. Pale palid skin withering away as finality crept ever closer and closer. She coughs, wet and phlegmy, a glob of bloodied snot spitting out and disintigrating into the sheets. 

"What... what time is it?" her voice croaks. 

A damp wet towel is pressed to her forehead. "Morning," the reply is tired, so wrung out of emotions that all it can do is whisper. "How are you doing my dear? How do you feel?"

She opens her mouth to respond, but something else shoves its way out. Vomit: yellow, acidic and warm. It spills out onto the bed, just enough to drench the sheets, but little enough due to her previous regurgitations. 

"Here," a frigid glass is pressed to her lips. It hurts to touch, biting at skin and bone, and the water is even more so. The deluge almost makes her vomit it right back up, but a hissed breath and whispered curse keep it down. 

"I..." she whispers.

"You'll be fine," even in the situation, even in spite of the doubt in his voice, he brings all his scared courage to the forefront, "You'll be fine," he repeats, "You're getting better. Heaven be damned I will spend an eternity by your side if that is what it takes for you to get better. I won't let you go."

She meets his wavering confidence with her own, "Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere."
