STORY:
================================

On screen, a human sat on a flimsy piece of cardboard, hands outstretched.

"Sup bruh, what'cha playin?" Mal'vek asked, settling into a beanbag next to his buddy.

"Oh, just some John Smith 5." Xith'rar replied, tentacles pushing buttons on the controller.

"Oof, you doin a homeless run?"

"Ya, I'm tryin to 100% the game."

"I've heard it's impossible to win on that difficulty." 

"Nah. Hard, but not impossible. See? Look, another human's coming over to give my character some money! A few hundred more and my guy can get a room for the night, get cleaned up... apply for a job..."

On screen, a man in a suit approached the homeless player character and yelled at him to "Get a fuckin' job." Then walked away.

"Yeah, good luck with that buddy." Mal'vek said, pulling out some chips.

...

A few hours later, a black Crown Vic pulled up to the curb Xith'rar's character was panhandling on.

A man stepped out. Flashed a badge at Xith'rar's avatar.

A window pops up on the screen, with white text overlayed on a black background. 

**Agree to be a CI for the police?**

*Y/N*

"Oh, that's new." Mal'vek said.

"Pog! This could be my guy's break!" Xith'rar tapped the X button with a wet appendage.

**Y**

Ding!

The suited man handed Xithrar's character an envelope. It was flush with cash. The other half once he's back next week, in exchange for Xithrar's avatar giving him the information on a drug deal that's supposedly due to happen in an alleyway he's to post up in.

An objective marker displays on the HUD, pointing North.

Xith'rar dutifully moves his character, watching the avatar shuffle with a hunched back towards the marker.

He saw a status debuff pop up in the top right corner at around the 5th in-game hour mark. Alcohol withdrawals.

"Damn, your guy's in pretty bad shape. Get him some booze bro."

"I can't, I gotta make him watch this alley..."

Few hours in-game later (about 20 minutes alien time), a couple of white vans pull up at the end of the alley. It's pitch black out, dead of night, and Xith'rar's character is momentarily blinded by the sudden implosion of light from the headlights.

6 hard looking men, tatted up and waving guns around converge from both sides in the middle. 

Xith'rar's fourth eye is furrowed in concentration, as he taps a series of buttons in time with the character's heartbeat to remain undetected, making himself small in a pile of trash.

3 men on one side, of Asian descent, 3 men on the other, looking Mediterranean - possibly Italian mafiosos. Briefcases change hands. Mafioso sniffs the product. A tense few seconds, guns shaking on both sides. He nods. The men smile. Asian gangster opens the briefcase on their side, takes a quick glance at the money, counts it. Nods.

They split as quick as they came, each in their own vehicles on opposite sides of the alley.

Xith'rar chews his lower mandible, trying to keep up with the button prompts in the Memory QTE event, made harder by the Alcohol withdrawals and Fear debuffs. His pores leaked sweat and his tentacles got slimy but he managed to enter the buttons perfectly. Memory stored - faces of the mobsters and gangsters, make and model of the vans, nature of the deal and what was traded, and even license plate numbers.

"...Fuck yeah." Xith'rar wiped a bead of sweat from his pores and reached an appendage to the mini-fridge, took out some Splountain Dew Red, and poured it down his gaping maw.

"Damn, getting sweaty with it! Nice dude." His buddy slapped Xith'rar across the back.

A week in-game passes.

Cop comes back, and Xithrar's character tells all in perfect detail. Fat envelope of cash get!

Xithrar pilots the homeless player character to rent a small room with the money. Makes him shower, get a nice meal in his belly. Makes him enter an Alcoholics Anonymous group to get clean. Meets every Tuesday and Thursday.

Xithrar presses buttons and makes his character apply to jobs, any job. Eventually gets a job scrubbing toilets at a McDonald's. A thankless, backbreaking job, but it's a paycheck. 

**Achievement Unlocked: Bootstraps** - *Starting as Homeless, get a place to live and a job.*

"FUCK YEAH bro!" Xithrar turned and high-tentacled his buddy. "Just got the last achievement! 100%ed that sucka!" He gulped down the rest of his Splountain Dew red, then sighed in content.

"Damn bruh. Congrats. Now go touch grass. Some maidenless behavior I've just witnessed." Mal'vek said.

"You're just jealous I 100% the game. Look, only 0.5% of other players have gotten this achievement."

"I mean yeah, cos everyone else has to work while you just sit on your ass controlling some rando human a few light years away. Shit, how is this even allowed honestly? Shit's unethical!"

"Bruh calm down. The humans agreed to it. Was either that or have their planet glassed." Xithrar said, gulping down a mouthful of Sway's Lotato chips. "Who the fuck cares anyway, you some kinda human-lover?"

"... Guy that wastes hours of his life playing the lives of humans c
