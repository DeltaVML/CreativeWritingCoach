STORY:
================================

It was all a bit confusing, to say the least. I didn't know what to make of it. I spent most of my days wandering around the gorgeous Colorado landscape, trying not to think too much about it all. It wasn't until I found myself at a local coffee shop that I started to feel a bit more at home.



I sat down in the corner of the coffee shop, my fingers curling around my coffee mug and giving it a squeeze. It was soothing, having something to hold onto.



"Hey," a voice said suddenly. I looked up to see a girl, probably around my age - or a least the age I appeared to be-, with curly brown hair and a wide smile. "I'm Madison," she said, and held out her hand.



I smiled back at her and shook her hand. "I'm Lueius," I said.



"Well, Lueius," Madison said, "can I get you anything else?"



"No, I'm okay," I said. "Just enjoying my coffee."



"You got it," Madison said, and went off to help another customer.



I turned back to my coffee and took another sip. It was strong and bitter, just the way I liked it. It tasted good. I was enjoying it while it lasted, because it wouldn't be long before my time in Colorado would come to an end.



It was inevitable. At some point, one of the humans would start to wonder why I didn't age. 



"Do you have time to talk?"



I looked up to see a girl standing in front of my table. She was slender, but had a powerful presence about her. She had long black hair, which she had tied behind her head, and there was a tiny smile on her lips.



I gestured to the chair across from me. "Please," I said.



She sat down. She crossed her legs and smiled with her teeth. She looked around the coffee shop, and then she looked back at me. Her eyes were the most fascinating shade of green I'd ever seen. They glimmered with curiosity.



"You're not from around here," she said. It wasn't a question.



"Why do you say that?" I asked.



"You're not a tourist," she said. "Not with that outfit. But you're not from around here, either. You're not a local. And definitely not one of the college students. So that leaves only one option: you're new in town."



"My parents live here," I said.



"If you say so," she said. "I'm Aya. What's your name?"



"I'm Lueius."



"Lueius," Aya said. "That's quite a unique name."



"I've been called worse," I said



"And why are you sitting here in a coffee shop all by yourself?" she asked. "Shouldn't you be home with your parents?"



I shrugged. "I'm a free spirit," I said. "I like my freedom."



"Mhmm." She nodded. "Now tell me who you really are."



...



It was late when I got home. My parents were in bed, sleeping, so I just took the time to lay in bed, pondering what Aya knew. 



I didn't need to sleep. I just lay in my bed and stared at the ceiling. 



I felt a chill along my spine as I heard a knock at my bedroom door.



"Son," my father called, "are you in there?"



The door creaked open, letting in a sliver of light through the crack. I held my hands over my face, blocking out the light from the hall.



"Son?" My father's voice sounded concerned. "Are you okay? What's going on?"



I felt my father sit on the edge of my bed. He put a hand on my shoulder.



"What's going on, son?"



"I'm not your son," I said, and shoved my father's hand off my shoulder. He was taken aback by my brusque manner.



"Why are you acting like this?" he asked. "Is there something wrong? Why are you saying these things? Didn't you have a nice time with your mother and me yesterday? We took you out to dinner. We took you to the movies. You seemed to like the movie."



"I'm not your son!" I stood and walked to the door. I slammed it. I felt my anger rise as I clenched my hands into fists. I looked at my hands. Why wasn't I turning into my demon form? I needed to turn into a demon! I needed to transform into a creature of Hell! I needed to let my wings grow out, and I needed to become the creature that I was.



But I didn't. Instead, I just stood there, clenching my fists.



I felt a presence behind me. It was my mother. I didn't turn to face her.



I didn't want to see her. I didn't want to see the looks on her face. I knew what was coming.



I got dressed. I pulled on my jacket and put on my shoes. I needed to leave. In my pocket I found Aya's number.



 I held my phone to my ear as I walked downstairs, then out the front door, slamming it behind me.



"Hello?"



"Aya?"



"Yes?"



"I need to meet with you."



"Of course. Where are you?"
