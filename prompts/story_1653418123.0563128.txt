I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The Control is a slight, unprepossessing man with long hair the color of a muddy river bottom, and brown eyes like dark cherry wood. He blinks often. It has been remarked upon in some circles, and the trait is now considered to have been common among precursor humans; after all, without magic of your own, how remarkable must the progress of the world seem? People smile when he blinks, wide-eyed and uncomprehending, as his head swivels back and forth like an infant in a brand new room.

The Control is blinking now, the world swimming in and out of focus as he squints between the soft, fuzzy edges, searching for that telltale glint of light.

The gremlins stole his glasses again.

The Control has never seen the gremlins exactly, but he knows they’re there. He imagines them as a stage in childhood development, opted into by thirty to forty percent of the misbegotten bastards who scurry all around him. The gremlins are two to three feet tall with green skin and green eyes and little corkscrew tails like pigs had in the storybooks before got people got to changing them. Their only purpose is to break things or to steal them, and sometimes (every time, where the Control himself is considered) they combine their two great passions, and poof! No more glasses for a week.

He claps his hands. He whistles. The sigils on the dressing room walls glow balefully back at him, refusing, as they always do, any form of help. He says the magic word that Tabby taught him, and is it his imagination, or does the pendant that he wears grow half an iota hotter? The magical circuitry sparking fitfully beneath the polished garnet as it tries, and fails, to carry out his wishes.

“Everything okay in there?” Tabby says. Her voice is small and sympathetic through the thick, oaken door.

“No. No, it’s not.”

“The gremlins again?”

The Control flops down onto the couch. He whistles one more time, and is it his imagination, or does the sigil twist a little tighter? A horse whinnies outside, and now the sigil moves, uncoiling itself like a snake about to strike as it arcs across the wall towards the sound. A blue streak against the fading posters, then gone.

“I’m coming in,” Tabby says.

The door opens and sunlight stabs in behind her. The Control curses, raising a hand to block the sun. She closes the door hurriedly, looks around with an expression of polite concern. *Are you eating enough? Do you need another book to read? You should talk to the houndkeeper’s apprentice, I think you could be friends.*

The Control loves Tabby. She’s as fundamental to his world as the air he breathes. She’s pretty, and she’s young, and she gives a shit.

“You’re sure you didn’t put them on the windowsill again?”

“I’m sure.”

“Or what about the bookshelf? Behind the Yeats? Last time they were behind the Yeats.”

“Tabby, I—”

“And the pendant didn’t help? Damn. I could make another pair but it will take a while. I don’t have the proper glass. Maybe a—”

“—A week,” says the Control. “Don’t worry about it yet, they’ll turn up. I think I’ve finally got a lead on the gremlins.”

He doesn’t, of course, but Tabby’s face lights up and when she smiles it’s okay to lie. It makes her happy to think that he’s engaging with the world.

The horse outside whinnies again, and then the hounds start up, their ten-part chorus of howls, a song that’s still cacophonous but in any case, they’re singing and that’s enough for what this is. Tabby bustles through the room. She peeks under the piles of books and clothes and old circus posters, unnerved as ever by the Bearded Lady, and though she doesn’t find his glasses every stop sees another garment in her hands. A t-shirt here, a pair of blue jeans there.

Tabby wears a robe of midnight black cinched tight at the waist by a band of frozen starlight. Her hair is woven through with cloth of gold, and whenever she smiles the color twists to catch the light. A neat trick, if unusually reserved in these parts, these times.

The Control dresses behind a conjured screen, slipping Tabby’s pendant into his pocket. When he’s done she eyes him critically, smoothing a crease here, brushing stains off there. It takes a little longer every time, another thing that he appreciates.

The horse whinnies again. It stamps its foot, and the whole dressing room shakes. Tabby keeps him there another thirty seconds, and then it’s time and there’s nothing more that she can do.

“I’ll see you after?” she says.

“In the morning,” he says.

The Control can’t bear to see her, after.

He leaves Tabby at the door. She’ll try and fail to straighten his room, her magic barely leaving in a dent a place that’s become so thoroughly him. She’ll leave a note on his pillow though, just a little something, a snippet of a poem perhaps, and he’ll hold it for a while when he comes back. As the horse is locked into its traces, and they fly off into the sunset.

The Control steps out into the world. His dressing room is a carriage, mounted on heavy, bright painted wheels.
