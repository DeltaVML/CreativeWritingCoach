STORY:

After the third cow screamed at Thomas, and squirted out the rancid smelling black milk, he had had enough. He tore off his gloves and stormed inside the two bedroom ranch house. Picking up the phone, he took a moment to peer out of the window towards the barn. The cows screamed again, this time at each other. There was no mistaking it for a common moo, this was an ethereal screech. The sky was well into dusk, the moon was full, and the streetlights in the small town of Duncecap, Massachusetts were notorious for flickering and fading if they came on at all. Luckily Thomas kept a few makeshift torches in the cellar. 
       The dial tone rang longer than he wanted. As he was tapping his feet against the linoleum, he heard the click of the other line,
       “Hello?” The voice said.
       “Gerald, it’s me, Thomas. You got a minute to come on by? It’s serious.”
        After a long sigh, Gerald replied. “Okay, Thomas, but if it’s about the Elwoods again-“ before he finished he was cut off by Thomas.
       “Of course it is. Come over, quick.”
        Gerald had only lived a swift two block walk from Thomas’s home, and was knocking on the door in no time. The sky held onto its gray demeanor, but Thomas knew it was only a matter of time before the true dark set in. Thomas handed Gerald a torch the moment the door was opened, and quickly snatched his collar to bring him inside. As Gerald began to protest Thomas shushed and hollered at him to settle down, navigating the hallway into the hideous lime-green kitchen his wife so badly wanted to decorate. Actual limes were used in some of the decorations scattered along the shelves and atop the cupboards. The paint on the walls was enough to make Thomas puke most of his passing bys, but the brightness was welcomed in these dark times. 
      “Now Thomas,” Gerald began, “What is the big fire this time?”
      “How have you not noticed something is afoot, Gerald? The damn moon’s been full for nine months now. Isn’t that suspicious? And look here!“ Thomas revealed the hideous jar of ink-black liquid. It sloshed around like syrup. Without warning he unscrewed the top and the foul smelling milk assaulted Gerald’s nose.
      “Dear lord! Put that thing away!” Gerald began to retch, “Oh heavens, mercy me. Where did you get that? What even is it?” 
      “My damn cows have been producing vile filth for the past two months. And they scream, Gerald, like someone’s murdering them. It’s downright awful. I talked to Mary Anne at the general store the other day and she told me that the talk of the town is: all the brooms are missing.”
     “Well,” Gerald said, scratching the scruff on his chin, “why’s everyone misplacing their brooms?”
     “Gerald you fool, do you think the whole town is misplacing their brooms? Mary Anne can’t replace her stock fast enough! She goes into the back room and they’re all gone! Now I know you ain’t a farmer, so you might not have noticed anything strange with your livestock, but when’s the last time you saw Josephine sweeping the house?” 
     Gerald took a long moment to ponder the question. “You know, I don’t think I’ve seen her do it in quite some time. But what if it’s a coincidence?”
     Thomas groaned and took a look out of his window once more. The gray of the clouds was replaced with pitch black, and the only light was the full moon in all of its ominous yellow glory illuminating the fields. Since the cows screamed instead of mooing, he hated to make any noise outside this late in the evening but he needed physical proof. 
      “Come on then, let’s go.” He said.
      The neighbors went out the back porch and Thomas made sure to bring his harvest scythe and hand cranked lantern with them. The lantern was dim enough that Thomas wasn’t concerned it would disturb any cows or draw attention to themselves. Once they reached the outer layer of corn, Thomas handed Gerald the lantern. 
     “Pay attention and keep that lantern still,” Thomas warned. He swiped at the cornstalks, and Gerald gasped. Thick, viscous blood seeped from the stalk, and as Thomas handed it over to him, he finally heaved out his canned veggie dinner from earlier. 
      “We gave up on the harvest four months ago,” Thomas said, still and cold, Gerald saw his face contained no emotion. His voice was dry, “I’m telling you, Gerald. Something ain’t right. When did the Elwoods roll into town? Eh? It’s been about nine months hasn’t it?”
      Gerald nodded, keeping a hand over his mouth and nose to refrain from vomiting again. 
      “And the moon’s been full for that long as well. They struck me as odd the moment I laid eyes on them. They stick themselves up in that old manor up by Lake Drive. They been seen talking to the Coopers, and now nobody’s seen them in a while neither. Mary Anne, bless her old bones, she said she saw them come in not long ago and the mother Elwood was babbling under her breath about some potion or doohickey that can control the moon. Some folk say Mary Anne
