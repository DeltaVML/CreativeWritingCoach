STORY:

"Look! That famous celebrity will visit our city!" he exclaimed, pointing to the TV. "There's going to be a publicity event for the film you got us tickets to"

His boyfriend smiled and nodded. "That's right, I think that's because the film is based on a local legend. You know, the one about the cheerleader who ended up being a serial killer in the 80's?"

James nodded. He definitely knew the story, he went to the same high school as that girl, so people talked about it almost every day.

"I'm pretty sure we could go together," James said. "You're always talking about the movie, I know you'd like it."

Ryan grimaced.

"I'd love to, but I have a work trip that week, remember?"

James deflated. "Oh, yeah. I forgot..."

"Hey, what about this." James looked up at the sound of his boyfriend's voice. "I'll try to sneak out of that day's meetings and we can go to the event together. The other city isn't too far anyway, so I won't have to travel for too long." Ryan smiled. 

James nodded enthusiastically. 

"Sounds like a plan!" 

----------------

It was a terrible plan. James has been in the queue for the event for hours and hasn't received a single text from Ryan. Did he forget? Was he able to cancel his meetings? What if his car crashed on the way here and James was a terrible boyfriend for being at a celebrity event instead of at his side?

His phone pinged with a message.

&gt;*Where are you?*
-

&gt;*I'm near the door, we'll be able to get in as soon as they let us. U here yet?*

James sighed. He's been here for hours, since he wanted to get in early to get a good place for his boyfriend. 

He felt really lonely in the middle of the crowd. Most of these people were probably dying to get a glimpse of the actors, while James was just there to spend time with his boyfriend. The people on the posters were unknown to him, and it doesn't help that the actors all look like generic famous people. You know the type: fair-skinned, conventionally attractive, symmetric faces, the whole deal. Although, one of the main actors kinda looked like his boyfriend. That would be fun to tease him about, maybe it was the hair? 

He checked his messages.

&gt;*Find the nearest service entrance to the left, gotta show you something*

James frowned.

&gt;*I'll lose our place in the queue. We won't be able to get in if I leave, there's too many people.*
-
&gt;*Trust me on this one ;)*
-
&gt;*If we don't get in I'm going to be mad. I've been waiting for hours.*

He pocketed his phone and reluctantly got out of the queue. He felt a little awkward on his way there, all of the people going in and out of the door were obviously related to the event. Did Ryan sneak in? 

He looked around, but he couldn't see his boyfriend. He quickly called him, not wanting to get in the way of the workers. 

"*Hi babe!*" the sound of his boyfriend's voice greeted him. He was definitely there, judging by the sounds of people that were coming through the phone. 

"Ryan, it's me. Where are you and why did you make me go to the service entrance? I can't see you anywhere." 

"*Wait, let me go get you.*" Again, the sound of rustling and a few 'excuse me's could be heard. "*Look at the door, babe.*" 

James looked up and saw his boyfriend waving at him from the other side of the door. Wide-eyed, he approached him and ended the call.

"What are you doing here? How did you get in?" He asked while following him inside.

"I said I wanted to show you something". Ryan answered nonchalantly, before taking his hand and guiding him through a door.

The room looked a lot like a dressing room. It was definitely a dressing room, so why did his boyfriend take him there?

"I know you're probably confused, so let me explain." Ryan said after closing and locking the door. "I've kinda been lying to you. A little. By omission." He grimaced.

James smiled nervously, looking around. "I'm a little worried now. Care to explain how you've been lying to me?"

His boyfriend nodded.

"Well, I kind of didn't tell you because being with you was really comfortable, but this is the biggest project I've worked on yet and people are definitely going to start bothering us about me so..." He took a deep breath. "I'm an actor. In this film, specifically. Most of my work trips and my weird hours are from filming and other events. That's also why we always hand out at your apartment and why I like our dates to be in private places"

James could only stare at him. That was not the worst thing that could have happened. But it was really unexpected and it was weird that he never noticed.

"Are you mad?" Ryan asked, grimacing. 

James blinked. 

"it's... definitely something. I'm mostly confused as to why you didn't tell me before. Or how I didn't notice. Is this your movie then?" 

Ryan nodded. 

"I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to treat me differently once you new. And, well, you didn't notice mostly because you're very face blind." He offered a weak smile. "There was a poster of my on a b
