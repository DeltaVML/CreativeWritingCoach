STORY:

He was shaking, his hands on his knees, panting. His opponent, clutching his ribs smiled through cracked teeth.

"I'll admit. You gave me quite the run for my money. But I'm afraid, I'm simply too durable."

Mackanika looked up and spat out blood. "You son of a bitch backhand..."

Backhand grinned. "Naughty language isnt alright."

Mackanika stood up, balling his fists up. hitting his earpiece a few times.

"I think my friend, that I have won. You've expended everything against me." Laughed Backhand, straightening up and fixing his suit jacket.

"No. Not everything." Grinned Mackanika. "I'm sorry, but you've forced my hand."

"Oh?" said Backhand, watching impassively as Mackanika selected one last song. The music was played through the half-broken system, Backhand heard a familiar refrain of brass and guitars. He tilted his head.

"What on earth?"

Mackanika took on a new stance "You might be fucking durable Backhand, but I? I'm fucking unstoppable. And you are far from an immovable object."

Mackanika shot forwards as Backhand heard the beginning of the refrian

*"Standing here, I realize"*

Backhand's eyes widened, "No... No not like this... Anything but this!"

He turned and tried to run, the nature of Backhand's power made him able to absorb massive amounts of kinetic energy, effectively nullifying said energy. But no matter how much he was able to absorb, he had a limit. Everybody has a limit. And that day, Mackanika found that limit. After three hundred punches that were harder than anything he'd ever thrown; Backhand finally collapsed. Mackanika dropped to one knee, his eyes burning, shoulders heaving, sweat and blood intermingling.

"In the end... It has to be this way."
