I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My father's brother asked my mother if he could take me out and teach me how to fish. My mom was excited that he would want anything to do with me, especially since I was obviously his child. (My father had been infertile since birth.) After being traumatized by this man over, and over, I felt my powers come to life, and couldn't help but ask him, "does it burn? Does it feel like you're being split in half, you worthless piece of shit?"

That's what it felt like for me, and I hope that my powers over slowing down time to make it feel the same way for him.

Edit: for spelling

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.
