STORY:
================================

“So. You want me, of all people, to give up magic? Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?”

The one nicknamed The Immortal Mage was not amused. He had seen many silly things over his life- including the unification of all races. The man could not fathom why they thought that was a good idea, nor why they thought asking him to give up his livelihood was acceptable. He hasn’t even cast a spell in a couple thousand years!

“Now- we know it’s a tall order. But-” The harpy tried to negotiate. 

“No buts! Tell me why.” He growled, glaring at the 5 other members in the council. The mage could detect their armies outside. The harpy cowered. Pitiful.

“You know why. Cursing entire races is cruel. We know you might be stuck in your old ways, mage, but we’re prepared to fight.” This time it was the wolverine that spoke. He remembers when their ancestors fell from the heavens. Now the Mage was wishing he had never done that because their species was annoying. 

“Well this peace you’ve conjured is ridiculous! It won’t last very long- I’m only speeding up the process!”  

The wolverine scowled at him, prepared to speak when the fae interjected. “It might last without your interference! Come on, man, accept the offer! We’ll give you anything you desire!”

“What I desire is the fall of kingdoms! A great tragedy for generations to come, to tell! I want a story.” They were all at their breaking point, he could tell. As the Mage was standing, the siren commanded him to stay. Damn fish. The Naga slithered around the rock they were using as a table and coiled around him, speaking. 

“We can give you a story. Not a tragedy. Not a tragedy. The story of how we united. Yes. We can give you that. Yes we can.”  

The Immortal Mage considered it, but when he tried to recall a story of peace, his mind came up blank. Only tragedies survived through history. He shook his head. The wolverine smirked.

“Fine. Not even a Mage as legendary as you can handle the wrath of all 5 races fighting for their lives.” The wolf started whistling- howling! What an ugly noise. Before the Mage could complain, though, he heard the stomping of a million feet and the beating of a thousand tiny wings. He sighed.

“Have it your way.” He cast the curse. Contrary to what many believed his spells weren’t grand nor were they big. He had no mana cap, sure, but he was not a flashy guy. In an instant, everyone stopped. The harpy gasped as its wings fell off and its talons melted into skin. The wolverine became nothing more than a beast in clothes, ripping into the fae beside it. The fae tried to fly away but found it couldn’t, for it had no wings. The siren tried to sing. The siren suffocated. The naga wanted to shift into its snake form and slither away but found it was cut off, stuck between the two forms.  

And the Mage laughed, as kingdoms fell. This would surely be remembered for millennia.
