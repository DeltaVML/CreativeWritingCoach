I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

“How in the hell do you accidentally kill someone?! How many years have you had in this job? There must be someone above you I can talk to.” I know, I sound like a Karen. But this is my life we’re talking about. A crappy meal I’ll smile, say the food was great and let it slide, late delivery I’ll grit my teeth and happily accept it. I don’t complain. This is different.



“Look, I’m sorry for what’s happened to you. Is there anyway we can avoid this getting higher? I can resurrect you? Would that work?” Death’s voice booming and bouncing off the walls of the void I’ve found myself in.



“Well yes actually I’d like that a lot! But for me to get resurrected isn’t enough anymore. I have to deal with showing up to my loved ones who have just lost me. That’ll be a fun conversation which I’m sure you won’t be around for. I can only pray they haven’t started any paperwork yet because when I return there will be literal hell to pay!!” 



“Fine, how about this, I’ll place you in the 1%? No more worries, no more troubles and...”



“Yes, I think that should do it, now get me back!” I interrupted him but please understand I was in such a rush to get back to life.



“Very well. I shall see you when your time comes, 24 years, 8 months, 3 days, 2 hours, 54 minutes, 7 seconds...and counting”



Well that was unnecessary. I ought to complain about that too. But being in the 1%? I’ll be richer than my wildest dreams!! I wonder how I’ll explain it? Ah who cares. A lottery ticket is a good excuse as any.



*FLASH*



I awoke. Vivid memories of what felt like a dream but I knew was much more. As my eyes begin to open I see a woman stood over me coating me with some kind of wax. She screamed. Understandably. The next few minutes was the most painful experience of my life. If you’ve ever woken up having slept on a limb and then blood starts coming back causing excruciating pain. Imagine that feeling spread across your entire body, every extremity, every inch of skin. At that point in time, I was wishing myself dead once more. 



About 10 minutes had passed and I was finally able to sit up and take in my surroundings. Outside the window were some blue flashing lights. She called the police. Understandably. Standing up I felt cold to the bone, this place could use some central heating. Or more so, maybe I could use some central heating. Anyway, I’m being in the 1% club I can buy by way out of whatever predicament I find myself in. Not that I should be arrested since it’s hardly my fault I died and came back to life.



“Please exit the building in a calm manner with your hands on your head!” bellowed a policeman. Following his instructions I strolled towards what seemed to be the exit. I was correct. Upon exiting the building my hands were clasped behind my back and encaged within handcuffs. 



“Thomas Grimshaw, you are under arrest for insurance fraud. You have the right to remain silent, anything you do say may be given in evidence...” he continued. But all I could think about is the money in my bank account. 



“Am I going to the hospital?” I queried, hoping I might be able to have the chance to call someone to check my balance in my bank. 



“You are not. The circumstances of your death were suspicious and the coroner could determine no cause of death. He suspected you had frozen yourself to claim life insurance. It’s appears he was correct.”



“Now that’s just unreasonable, how in the hell could I have frozen myself? Look, do I get a call? How much is my bail? I’m sure I can afford it”



“Not with all your assets frozen you can’t.”

 

“What?” 



“You see, since the claim was already processed we’ve been forced to freeze  all your assets until this can be sorted out. You can however call someone else to bail you out.”



The police officer searched me. He reached into my pocket and came across a piece of paper which read ‘Congratulations Mr Grimshaw! You’re now in the 1% club! This now means that whatever game you play, you’ll always be 1% better than your opponent. Chess, Tic Tac Toe, anything! The only condition is that this can’t be used for gambling or provide yourself with any monetary advantage. Sorry again for the mix up. Enjoy your life!”



Perfect.
