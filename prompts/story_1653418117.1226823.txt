I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"One day, humans said "You know what would be cool? Making that "God is dead and we killed him" joke a reality.", and everyone agreed.


Thus starting the fifteenth intergalactic war. The humans tend to do this thing called "murdering everything that ain't them", starting with their own planet and working outwards. Everytime a war started, it was the humans with "You know what would be ____?", insert something about killing something, and then said thing goes to war with the humans, and the humans somehow fucking win. 


So, this time, their targets are literal gods. This is the third time they've fought immortal beings. What crackhead being thought that they should allow them to do this? Which imbecile who's supposed to be the defender of everyone else let a child who probably doesn't even understand how to play that cosmic game of chess play for them? Did a really good chess player from earth win in every chess match they've ever played against other beings much higher than the lowly humans?


Whatever, point is, the gods are dead, and we're next. What the fuck do we do?"


"... Are you stupid? We ARE humans. They aren't going to target us. Even if they did, they'd certainly be surprised to see one of their own out here. We'll just explain everything calmly. Hopefully they'll believe us... Oh, you're dead. That's unfortunate. Anyways, hi, hello, I'm human too. Wonderful to meet you... Oh um... You seem to have um... Accidentally stabbed me. You shouldn't be swinging that absentmindedly.


What do the mean "I'm not human"? I'm a human! What do you mean that would be a fatal wound and this place doesn't have oxygen. This place is filled with oxygen. You know, you're being rather rude to me right now, and you killed my traveling companion. How are you going to compensate me?


You won't? Well fuck you too! See how you like getting stabbed! See, not so nice, is it, now? Get fucked you little prick. You're not even 5'4."


(And I ran out of ideas)
