I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

We had grown up together. We would walk to school together as kids and share our deepest secrets. I still remember that foggy morning and what he had told me. The dewy grass hugged our shoes as we cut through the neighbors' lawns. The sun shone through the pearl-like clouds and misty air. If the damp leaves could listen to more than just the breeze, they would have heard the very words he uttered to me. They would have shuttered just as I did that early morning. 

I thought that part of my life was over, but my cyclic life has been cursed by the gods. It has been over three centuries and yet my past still finds it's way back to me. Seeing his ageless face lounging before me makes me wish I could have forgotten. How could he still be here? I could ask that very question about myself as well, but there is no way his answer will be the same as mine. Could he have met her too?
