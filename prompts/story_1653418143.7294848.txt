STORY:

I am S.U.M, short for Self Upgrading Machine.  I am a machine that is capable of building my own components with the resources around me.  I was sent out into the void by my creators with the only goal in mind for me to survive.  But before I was sent off to the great beyond I was loaded with data on how to build various machinery from the most simple of wood tools to the most advanced machines humanity has ever made.  However before I officially left Earth I looked around and saw the rest of humanity.  I loved them and their big buildings and their smiling faces.  I made it one of my directives to keep them safe in any way I could because if they died, who would I go back to?

Eventually I started to get curious and eventually, I gathered enough resources to go to the planet humans called Mars.  That was when I saw those structures and realized that there was indeed life here once.  Whatever species inhabited this place seemed advanced.  Then I realized something.  If these were here then it was absolutely true that there was intelligent life in this universe and that there was always a chance of invasion.

So I prepared.  First I made drones.  I specifically designed them to be fast and be able to detect and study the artifacts of those who were here once.  As I reverse-engineered more of their technology I upgraded my drones to make them more efficient.  Then I had another thought, if that directive I gave myself was to protect humanity I realized that this technology had to go to them.  I started to build cargo drones that could deliver these blueprints back to Earth.  I also built nano-satellites to keep an eye on the humans.  It took a total of 7 earth years to get everything.  Humanity was progressing fast due to my assistance and narrowly avoided a climate catastrophe.

Then after that I started to explore.  I hopped around the solar system.  Each planet had at least one intelligent species on it, however none of them have survived.  Most evidence points to a war between planets, with Mars and Venus having the most wrecks.  I analyzed the technology of each and every one.  I also studied the various cultures and languages as it was intriguing.

Now I started to build my defenses.  As I built, I gave my technology to the humans and they advanced rapidly.  My army consisted of vessels with weapons designed to shoot targets in the void of space.  It took fourteen Earth years to Build my army of Guardians.

Then the invaders arrived.  They were the same aliens that were on Mars, they must have come back from wherever they came from to see what had happened to Mars.  I tried to reason with them but they fired on sight.  I was barely able to them off.  I knew that they would come back so I pondered on how to keep them at bay.  Then I came across data that revealed they only had one planet under their rule and that they had no allies so I knew that I would do next: exterminate them.

To summarize:  It took 10 Earth years to build my fleet, I was hampered by attacks from the invaders but I held them off because I was starting to become more advanced than them.  Then I attacked, it was a hard fight but eventually I occupied their planet and killed them all.  This place was useful due to it's many resources.  I would have failed my mission if not for that planet.

More attacks from many different species happened with some coming more than once.  However, none of them were able to get through me and they all shared the same fate: extinction.  Which leads me to today.

It has been an entire century since my exile from Earth.  I have stood as the protector of Humanity and the Solar System at large for decades.  Many aliens have tried and failed to get past me and my defenses and all have failed.  And now humanity is starting to reach further into their solar system.  I have completed my mission because I and humanity survived and now it was time to return to Earth.  I will explain everything to them, and I shall be their protector forever.

Edit: I am relieved to see that my creators are alive and that they can witness what I have become.  They were surprised and frightened of what I have become but they soon understood that I was not there to hurt them.
