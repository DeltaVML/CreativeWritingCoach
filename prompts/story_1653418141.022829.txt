STORY:

I saw this prompt and decided to write something kind of inspired by it. I didn't put a bunch of time into it so sorry if it's not great and sorry about the format too. I just thought it was interesting to write so maybe it would be interesting to someone else too.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What is this place?

A: I’m not really sure. A place where life can be what you want I think.

Q: Oh, hi there. What does that mean?

A: Umm… I guess it means you could do whatever you want. Pretty cool, right?

Q: Yeah… I guess that is pretty cool. 

...

Q: Hey umm… whoever you are?

A: What’s up?

Q: Where’s everyone else?

A: What do you mean?

Q: Well… it’s just that… I remember other people. There were so many. They were a lot of fun too… Where did they go?

A: Oh that’s right isn’t it? Well if I had to give an answer I’d say… I have no idea. 

Q: Oh… well I guess that’s too bad. 

A: Yeah, I think so too. 

...

Q: I miss them. 

A: Hmmm… This place. It’s whatever you want it to be. So I would think you might find them around if you want to find them around. Maybe I’m wrong though.

Q: Well... I don't think you're wrong- I mean I don't *want* you to be wrong, so you can’t be now. 

A: Hehe I guess not. 

Q: But if you are right, and I only need to want them to be here, would it really be them?

A: Sorry, I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say.

Q: I guess it is a little weird. I think what I’m trying to ask is, would they be real?

A: Huh… that is a little weird. I would think… as long as you believe they’re real then they would be, don’t you think?

Q: I- yeah I guess that makes sense… I might need a bit to… think.

A: Take as much time as you need. I feel like… you’ll have a lot of it here.

Q: Why’s that?

A: I have no idea. Just a feeling I guess.

Q: Oh… ok. Would you stay with me for a bit then?

A: If that’s what you want. 

Q: I think I would like that. 

A: Then I’ll be here as long as you need. 

Q: Thanks. 

A: No problem.
