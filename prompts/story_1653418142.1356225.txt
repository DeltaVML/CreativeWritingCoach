STORY:
================================

Suddenly stars started appearing all throughout my field of vision as if I stood up too fast and was about to faint. I felt my head tilt back as if behind me was “down”, but everywhere felt like down, up, left, right.

A mechanical female voice blaring from speakers throughout the starship - automated warnings in several system languages, the crackle of fire somewhere around a corner, all that noise suddenly sounded as if it were funneled down into headphones suddenly placed in my ears.

Most of the bright stars shielding my vision had started to dissipated, however waves of stars persisted and never entirely went away.

I struggled to focus my vision and realized I was saying something, but I couldn’t quite make out the words. I started to make out the shape of someone leaning against a wall in front me and they seemed hurt. I could see fear in their eyes and some parts of what felt like my brain lit up in excitement as if the sight of fear confirmed the revelation of a long suspected secret.

Then I heard my voice say, “even from yourself,” as I looked down at the figure, whom was slowly slumping down the wall. I realized I knew who that figure was: that figure was me. Somehow I was looking through the automaton’s eyes at myself in the very moment that my vision started to wane. I had to stop myself - the automaton - before it killed the real me!

I tried to gain control of the automaton’s arms and limbs, but it was as if my reflexes were supercharged and I flailed the limbs wildly smashing into the walls and the ground. I noticed the real me, the fleshy and organic being in my field of vision started to get up and run. Instinctively I reached out and grabbed my body and I suddenly felt a terrible feeling of dread if I were to allow myself to escape!

More stars - my vision was fading once again as the sound of the cacophony all around me faded. I was laying on a table or a reclining chair of some ergonomic design. I saw the outline of two shapes looking down on me and I ask, “am I alive?”

Then I heard a female voice speak: “Concerning vertices C6 through C9, his behavior is way outside of normal parameters…it comes across inauthentic and forced. I think we can continue to destabilize his mental state if we increase aggression and obfuscation of the conversation.”
