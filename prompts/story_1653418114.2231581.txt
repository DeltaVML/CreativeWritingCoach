STORY:
================================

It is a lie that we are whole.

We are legion- all of us.  A thousand impulses, a million might-have-beens, all inhabiting a single body.

We're pretty good at ignoring it.  Pretending that there's one, and only one, who holds the controls and steers the ship.  In the moment, we can feel this way.

It's easier to notice the lie when we look back- rifle through our  memories and watch helplessly as the ship of self sails in ways that we, in the here and now, find abhorrent, incomprehensible, or 'cringe'.

The question of the ship of Theseus is not whether it is the same ship.  The question is if  it makes sense to think of it all as one thing, composed as it is of a thousand parts, swapping out here and there without great consequence.

Still, it's a comforting lie.  The idea that we might be punishing an innocent person, who looks back at the crime with exactly the same horror as you...that's not helpful.  The criminal-in-the-moment may not think much of the other person who will come along later and inhabit their body, looking back in regret on their crimes, but we have precious few ways of influencing them after the fact *at all*.

We work with the tools we've got.

But it makes it all the more discomforting, to see yourself transformed, to see the lie so plainly exposed, the outer covering ripped straight down the middle.

Before, there was a man, in flesh and in form.  A man is his shape, and as a man he behaves.

Now, there is a great beast, fangs and fur and muscle and madness.  And as a beast, it behaves.  Less fearsome than foolish, but a beast nonetheless.

The terrifying bit is that everything is the same inside, before and after.  There is no magic that can warp a mind, not truly.  There doesn't *need* to be.  Given a new form, new strength, new instincts, new chemicals crawling through the body and brain, the mind adjusts, swaps in a new aspect.

It's a terrible secret that all werewolves keep- all men know, in their minds, how to be wolves.

It's horrifying enough to look upon yourself like that, to look back at your memories and wish you had done anything else.  But there's more to the lie than what you tell to *yourself*.

Because we are social creatures.  Wolves are, as well.  We create a self, and show it to the world, and take great care to make it seem alive, seem complete, seem *whole*.

We build relationships, and trust, and intimacy, and love.  And live all the while in fear, that the veil will drop, that we will be seen as we truly are- many, ever-changing, filled with as many madmen as saints.

Many a relationship has been torn asunder by a simple truth.  Ask those who have escaped the closet, who have come out as trans, how well even the closest relationships hold up in the face of an unexpected truth.

So werewolves hide.  They tell shallow lies to protect deeper ones.  They say that their loved ones would be in danger when they transform, that they might rip and maim and kill without any understanding.

In truth, a werewolf will only kill you when transformed if they would have killed you in their human form.  Wolves are social creatures, and would no more turn on their pack than we would.  The added strength and sharp claws make no difference whatever, any more than a beloved uncle would tear you apart simply because he started going to the gym.

No, werewolves hide because they are the same inside as they ever were.  It's simply a different portion of them brought to the forefront- the circumstances have changed, and so the *person* seems to change.  But they know their family, their loved ones, their friends.  They're still themselves, just with a new body and a new urge to howl and bark and piss on things.

They hide, and keep their secret.  Far, far better to be thought a monster than to be known for what you truly are.

Human.
