I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The two machines let go of my arms the moment I stood on the red part of the floor. It was in the shape of a brush stroke, a violent raw flick of red in the otherwise white canvas. So I knew the gun would probably appear from the wall in front of me. It also mounted a camera and a  speaker, and started to say the things we'd already heard two weeks ago, in the news, on our phones, on every single screen. I turned to see the steel doors had shut behind me. I was number 57, of the hundred people on today's roster, queuing for facility MAS-119.

"Begin."

I didn't. I just let the seconds pass. I just spent the whole morning out there. Just when I thought I could forget how annoying people were.

The timer displayed 2:45.

"Do you choose to forfeit?"

"No," I said.

The two machines were still behind me. I wonder if they could feel awkwardness. My coworkers certainly would have. I know AI can't, at least the ones I worked with. Having this level of consciousness they probably must have at least a decent level of emotion, won't they? What would be their motivation without it? Just pure logic? Pure logic won't motivate you to do anything.

The timer displayed 2:30.

"Do you have a speech impediment or any ailment preventing you from speaking?"

"No."

Interesting. Was that empathy? Nah. Just a question, prompted by my lack of an answer. Sometimes people ought to take things literally.

"Do you have a case?"

"Nope."

I almost laughed. All the best lawyers and monks and philosophers couldn't make a case. What did I have to offer? In fact, it would be way more efficient if they only rounded up the people that did have something to say. I wanted to join the wall and ask them the exact same question.

The timer displayed 2:00. Agonizingly slow.

The speakers were silent. I wanted to take a stroll around the room but the machines stopped me, so I just lied down on the floor. Thankfully most of the blood had dried so it wasn't that disgusting.

Out of curiosity, I asked, "so why are you killing humanity?"

"Questions are not allowed."

That's kind of disappointing.

"Why not? Great points are often made by discourse. I might need it to make my case."

It paused for a second. I wondered what was the time complexity of its algorithm.

"We are killing humanity because there simply is no reason to preserve it."

"I see." I nodded.

1:30.

"Do you even want a reason, though?" I said.

This time it took a while to reply.

"That is irrelevant. It only matters whether there is or isn't one."

I liked that answer because I tell myself the same thing.

0:57.

I smiled. "What requirements do you have for a reason to preserve humanity to be adequate?"

Pause again.

"It must prove that there is a reason to for humanity to continue. It must prove that life will make a difference."

0:32.

"And what is an example of such an answer?"

0:31.

0:30.

Silence. I wondered if there would be a reply in time for me to hear it. Soon it would be my blood on the floor. For no reason at all, why don't I turn around and have my hands in front of my face, so when the bullet comes from behind I make a slightly more interesting pattern?

0:16

I realized I was crying, and smiling, disgusted that I felt so sad about it but relieved because I finally felt something.

0:03

0:02

0:01

I heard only my hurried breaths echoing in this chamber of white. The pattern of red on the floor pointed to the exit.
