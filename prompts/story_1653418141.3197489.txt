STORY:

Rachel took one last look at her room. Was she really going to do this. Give up the throne because she didn't want to marry this one guy. She pride herself for her independence and could not in good coincidence marry someone she did not choose. 
It was around two in the morning. Everyone was asleep. Rachel just finished the letter to her parents, explaining why she was gone. She told them that she loved them but could not do this. It was time it is now or never. Rachel used the rope she made of bedsheets and jumped out of the window. In the garden was a guard she bribed to help her. They took the horses and rode to the forest not far from the palace.
'I know a guy, someone I arrested once. He is able to help you to get away from here.' The guard stopped for a moment. 'But princess, please be careful. Don't go with him to his camp, just let him help you to get across the border.' Rachel looked at him and nodded. Who was this strange man she was about to meet and why could he not be trusted. 

The sun was rising. Rachel was alone again. The guard needed to be back at the castle before everyone woke up. He told her to walk to the open field in the forest and wait there. It was not far from here, maybe an hour away. She heard something in the trees, probably a bird or something. She kept walking until she felt a sharp pain in rib. Before she could look what happened she was blindfolded and tied up. Rachel felt how someone grabt her by the arm and pushed her into a wagon. 

The road was unpleasant and long. Rachel could not see were she was going and felt scared. Why didn't she just stay home, marry the guy her parents chose for her.  They stopped and someone pushed Rachel out of the wagon and kicked her in the stomach. She was unable to move. 'Stop!' Someone shouted, the kicking stopped. 'This was not the deal. You agreed to bring her to me unharmed.' Rachel heard the disagreement of the man who brought her to this place. She felt how someone was untying her and remove her blindfold. She was staring in the brown eyes of a men. He was around her age and looks like he is the leader. He took out his hand to help Rachel up. She rejected it and came up by herself. 'Who are you?' She asked while cleaning of the dirt from her clothes. 'No thank you?' The man asked. 'For what? You kidnapped me, you man kicked me. Do you even know who I am?' She paused for a moment, she should not let people know what kind of status she has. They would probably sell your or use her as a bride for her parents. 'Where even are we?' Rachel asked after a while. The man smiled. You are at my camp, my name is Erik and yes I know who you are.' Rachel tried to look strong but she was scared for what was going to happen. 'But don't worry, my men don't know who you are and if you don't tell them, they will never know.' Erik winked at her. 

He showed her the camp, where she could sleep and after a few hours they ate together. Erik was also a runaway, but different. His mother was a bandit who died a few years ago. After that erik came to this camp almost dailey and took his mothers role over as the leader of the bandits. His father a nobel, rich and powerful. Erik was told to marry someone he had never met. Rachel felt weirdly comfortable with him. Maybe it was that they shared a similar story, or maybe it was something else. She decided to stay here to learn more about Erik. 

Five years went by and Rachel and Erik were happy. Together they had a child they named Chris, named after Rachel's father. They were sitting at the camp planning there next ambush when a messenger came by. He bowed before Rachel and gave her a letter. Rachel's heart started to beat faster, her eyes became watery and her hands were shaking. This could not be true, it was impossible. Why did she ever leave home. Her father, the king, was dead. He was murdered, just after his son the crown prince died of an unknown illness. She was the new queen and her serves were required at the castle. She showed the letter to Erik. He read the letter over and over again. 'I knew this time would come. You should go, take Chris with you and go back to the castle.' Erik said after reading the letter for the seventh time. 'I'm not leaving you alone. Come with me let's rule this land together. Be my king you were ment to be.' Erik looked up, it was time she should know the truth before leaving. 'Rachel my dear, I truly love you but I have not fully honest with you. I was the one you were supposed to marry, I was the reason you left home.' Rachel stepped back in shock. This was impossible. 'You lied to me?!' Rachel was furious. 'I just wanted to know who you were, I didn't expect to fall in love with you.' Rachel could not believe this, the man she sacrificed everything for, was also the man she wanted to escape so many years ago. 'I, I cannot be with you, not anymore. Not with knowing that you lied to me. I am taking our son and leave this place.' Erik looked down, tears in his eyes. 'Please
