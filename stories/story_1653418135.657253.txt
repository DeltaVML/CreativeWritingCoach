    
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Immortal walked back to his house in an introspective mood. His close buddy of twenty years was off to start the newest chapter in his life, and the Immortal knew he’d never see him again. He was both happy and sad for his mortal friend. “Ah well, best not to worry about it anymore. He’s a good man and will do well by himself.” He chuckled as he went back inside his quaint and lonely little cabin.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Why hello, old friend.” A familiar warm voice met him as he crossed the threshold, causing him to lift his head sharply. “As always, keeping your eyes on your feet. Are they really so interesting?” The woman in front of him was the only person as old as he was, and he had thought her dead for centuries.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Yet here she was, looking as joyful and young as ever.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”I know, I know. You thought I was dead.” She smiled from where she was sitting in his favorite chair. “And there’s a very good reason for that.” She cocked her head. “Well? Are you going to stand there gaping like a loony, or are you going to come kiss your wife hello?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Immortal choked back a sob of joy as he stumbled forward into her arms. He didn’t understand how this was possible. He had spent centuries searching every nook and cranny of the earth for her, and had found nothing. Yet here she was, holding him in her arms like nothing had ever happened. As if she had never left him.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He opened his mouth to say something, to ask her a question, to praise God, but all he could do was laugh and cry. All he could say was “I love you. I love you. I love you.” He held her tight against his chest, and then pushed her back to look at her again to make sure she was his wife. She was. He hugged her back to his chest again and sobbed and smiled into her neck. “I love you.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Stop, you’re making me cry too.” But she held him just as tightly, and he knew tears were running freely down her face. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They stayed like that for a long time. Just holding each other close. Until his Immortal wife took a deep breath and pulled back slightly. “I… I have something to tell you.” She said hesitantly.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He looked at her, drinking her in and committing every detail to his memory to last forever. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She took another deep breath and continued. “I did it. I fixed us.” 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He shook his head, not understanding. “Did what? Fixed what?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”I removed the curse.” She looked deep into his eyes, waiting for him to realize.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And then it dawned on him. He looked at her with a sudden joy so strong it completely engulfed the both of them. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The immortality was gone.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”I love you.”
