[poem]

All the
Has beens
True ar
-tificial brains

I'll take
One hit
Send it
Up quick

Say it ain't so 
I ain't no clone
Turn me back off 
I'll decompose

Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na

Last night
alone
Dying sucks
I know
They left me roses by the stairs
Even though they gave me hives everywhere

Just say it ain't so 
I ain't no clone
Turn me back off 
I'll decompose

Keep your
Head still
Swallow
This pill
Your life will go on 
Against your will....
