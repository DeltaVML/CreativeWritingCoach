My dragon courage gives me the strength to go to the beach tomorrow. I take off my human shirt and the beautiful bikini clad women look at my buff dragon body in awe. I nervously gulp and let out a little unsure grin. The girls flock to me like seagulls to a hot dog, my hot dog. It gets very steamy and I’m with 4 beautiful women of all different races and then I see my crush since I was 4, Vanessa. She’s shocked of my new dragon body, but I look her in the eyes with my different colored dragon eyes and I tell her “I love you”. We then fly off into the sky and I take her to a hotel and we make love and we both win prom king and queen a few weeks later. The End
