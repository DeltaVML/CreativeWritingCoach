Dr. Odhiambo's phone rang at 3 am, local time.  As she reached out to silence it and go back to sleep, she saw the caller ID describe the number as "NORAD."  She wanted to ignore it, but curiosity overcame her as she answered.

"Stephanie Odhiambo?"

"Yes..."

"There's an issue of national security requiring your expertise, a helicopter will pick you up in 20 minutes.  You'll be briefed on the flight."

"This is an incredible amount of effort for a prank." The doctor laughed out after being briefed on the situation.

"You'll see for yourself soon enough." The captain said with a tone of resigned acceptance.

"Ok let's say this is true, have you tried communicating with them yet?  Why do you even need me? They're going to speak English." The doctor of exo-linguistics generally avoided speaking in such certain terms, but the absurdity of the situation had her abandoning scientific caution, at least in conversation.

"What makes you think that?"

"Whatever this is, it's clearly using concepts from our culture when crafting its presentation."

"So the aliens are taking a form we can comprehend?"

Steph smirked, "well I'm glad you've watched *Contact*, but we don't know its motives, if it has them, or that it is an alien."

Standing amid the military tents set up near "the phenomenon"  Steph (she had decided this situation was too absurd to think of herself professionally) met up with a team of scientists and officers.  She could see the pie tin from here, but didn't give it more than a glance.

"Dr. Odhiambo! We're glad you're here.  We'd love your thoughts before you're exposed to our preconceptions."

"Have you ruled out collective hallucination?" She said dryly.

"We have taken a photograph, and in double-blind administration, people on the other side of the country have identified it as low-budget TV aliens."

"Have we made contact?"

"Let's hear your thoughts first."

"It's communicating a lot to us.  It has technology that far surpasses our own in order to present like this.  It has an understanding of our culture.  It's showing off it's power in a rather blatant way, but also in a way designed to be relatively nonthreatening.  Even playfully.  But there could be any motivation behind that.  Or none, it may be something with no motivation at alI, just reflecting our thoughts back to us.  But that seems like a stretch.  Well, everything seems like a stretch.  I take it that they already explained that they come in peace and wish to speak to our leader?"

"Keep going."  A general was now very interested.

"Do we have any evidence they're tangible?  Do we have materials samples of the socks?"

A scientist looked to the general who nodded.

"Some fibers were left behind as they walked. Poly-cotton blend."

"...Is there a wrist?"

"We haven't made any attempts to observe the internals."

The general steps forward "What thoughts do you have on courses of action?"

"If I'm here it's because one of you has read my paper on potential interview strategies once a common language has been established."

"Yes."

"So I could spend a few hours running through potential approaches, different directions it might go, and the general thought process, but I presume you have them waiting in an interview room now and we're at risk of being bad hosts."

"If you want to go in, you're in, I'll be in there with you.  Don't offer them anything that is not yours to offer."  The general said.

Steph sat across from the socks, the general at her side.

The blue sock with the googliest eyes spoke first, in a nasally voice.

"We come in peace."

Steph prioritized setting the right tone for the first contact.  She mustered an equally nasal voice and let out an enthusiastic "meeeeeeeep."
