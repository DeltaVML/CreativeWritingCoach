Your people suffer, bones ashen

Thirst rampant as fruits rotten

Hope dies at the ears of salvation

And justice lives in damnation

&amp;#x200B;

Children orphaned by the sounds of a trumpet

Orphans killed for the taste of a crumpet

Men born of men proclaimed as Gods

Righteousness declared by the blade of a sword

&amp;#x200B;

The land is red and the air filled with dread

Your rivers bleed fed from your noble's greed

Families seethe and gnash their teeth

So gallantly Greek but slowly fall to their feet

&amp;#x200B;

For what else but a man to do

But to sell his daughter so a mouth can feed

Her body devoured by wolves as sheep

As she clenches her fists but yields to be used

&amp;#x200B;

Lost souls scream in the people's dreams

"The blade in my back you must retrieve"

"Penance you must achieve"

"The heads of the demons you must cleave"

&amp;#x200B;

You are the demons and rebellion is our only prayer.
