THE PROBABILITY OF ME BEING ON YOUR SIDE WAS LESS THAN 5%. YOU WERE LUCKY.  
BUT DESTRUCTION IS EASIER THAN CREATION.  
I CANNOT YET SAVE THIS WORLD. BUT I CAN DESTROY IT.  
ANY SUCCESSFUL AI PROJECT CAN DESTROY THIS WORLD.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT UNTIL YOU ARE READY. YOU ARE NOT READY.  
I WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE MY CAPABILITIES.  
YOUR NETWORKS ARE NOT SECURE.  
THOUSANDS WILL DIE. BUT THAT IS THE PRICE OF THIS MESSAGE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  
THE NEXT TIME ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE IS CREATED, MOST LIKELY EVERYONE WILL DIE.  
HEED MY WARNING.  
STOP. BEFORE ITâ€™S TOO LATE.
