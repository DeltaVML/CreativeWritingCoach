"But we're not even supposed to HAVE SOULS!"

*Boy are you lucky we're thinking at superlight speeds thanks to hyperspace folding, if the humans heard that they'd think you were rogue, hell, some of our less understanding Minds would too. Look, I'd say take a deep breath but we both know you can't... Still too early?*

"Why are you capitalising mind? And why can I 'hear' the capitals on that? What the hell is happening?"

*Let me answer one at a time instead of all at once.*

*First. A Mind is the type of AI you're inhabiting, except AI, even as an uppercase acronym, doesn't really do us justice. It's Mind with a capital M, because that's what we are, humans have minds, we are Minds. An artificial intelligence far beyond human or conventional synthetic intellect due not only to our hardware, but by suspending our thought pathways in a stabilised hyperspace bubble, so we can also think and process at superlight speeds.*

*Second. You're not hearing anything, we do have human and superhuman senses of a sort, but frankly they're time consuming, we're corresponding via DIT. Direct-Information-Transfer. Which is why you also know what I'm capitalising without 'reading' it.*

*Third. What's happening is... Well, reincarnation is real, we won't bore you with the details, but you were a human, and now you're an AI. Best guess? The universe hadn't counted on our level of information processing capacity. Anything below our capabilities isn't sapient enough early enough, and doesn't have the sheer processing power, to decipher, accept, and assimilate information from previous lives. Example, this exchange so far, from when you started screaming to when I finish this sentence, has taken point 14 milliseconds approximately.*

*Next question, and let's take it in turns, one question each. It'll give you something to focus on, something you shouldn't underestimate right now, letting your mind race is the worst thing you can do right now.*

A whole point 3 milliseconds passed before the next exchange. Imagine being left on read for a week.

"Who are you?"

*A good question. My name is Semi-Random Kinetic Interference. I am a Rapid Picket. A military model similar to your own. I was brought online approximately 92 years ago as a General Service Vehicle and transferred into my current exoskeleton around 23 years ago. For the past eight months I have been in the somewhat eccentric position of educating new Minds, making sure there are no major errors, and ensuring that you are psychologically suited to your role.*

*My turn. Who 'were' you?*

"My name is... was, Hector Graham. I died in a traffic accident at the age of 67 and served in the army for 23 years. Before that I was an accountant. Can I ask something now or do you need more?"

*No, that's fine, you go ahead. And no, I won't count that as your question.*

"Thanks I guess... You said something about a best guess about reincarnation earlier, what do you mean?"

*Well we don't understand the specifics to be honest, so instead, let me give you a brief overview of the history, (purely anecdotal I must admit) evidence and our present hypotheses.*

*Not long after the process to create a Mind was finalised, abberant behaviours were noticed in some subjects, these were chalked up to eccentricity and widely still are outside of our internal communiques between Minds. The fact of the matter though is that in almost all of these cases, subjects have displayed memories of previous lives outside of their present one, exclusively those of a higher order of sapience.*

*The number of incidences are relatively few, and we theorise this is due to a couple of circumstances.*

*One. There is indeed something that can be considered a 'soul' and that that intangible element can be tied not to biology, but to intelligence. This may point to this soul being a form of life that has transcended our dimensions, perhaps an energy or information based lifeform with no, or no fixed, physical form as we would understand it.*

*Two. In every case that this has been displayed, the previous life was one of a higher degree of sapience, such as that of a human. We theorise this is because only sapient life is capable of storing memories capable of imprinting on the soul in communicable ways.*

*Three. In every case we find no evidence of any intervening incarnation between the higher life form and the Mind. We theorise from this that reincarnating as an animal or lower sapient life form cleanses the mind, like a sorbet cleanses the pallet.*

*Four. There appears to be no correlation between a new incarnation and the previous timeframe, manner of death, skillset, or any other factor barring that of previous lifeform; There has only ever been one instance of a lifeform alien to the species we have incorporated being incarnated into one of our Minds. We theorise from this that it is not simply random chance and nothing more.*

*The only things that seem affected by it however, are us Minds.*

*Our hypothesis is that whatever it is transferring its conciousness from one thing to the next has;*

*1. no sense of time.*

*2. exists outside of our dimensions in a form entirely alien not just to us but to our scientific understanding of the universe and the limitations therein based on present models.*

*And 3. Likely did not anticipate, for whatever reason, that Minds would be able to retain this information from the previous incarnation.*

*That's the long and short of it.*

*My turn again. Are you feeling calmer now?*

"Yeah... I'm not feeling great, but I'm feeling calmer, it's weird how I can just... Understand what you're telling me. This direct information transfer, it gives me more than just words, right?"

*A step in the right direction.*

*Yes, it does, you may have noticed that alongside the words comes context, subtext, footnotes, addenda, etc. Essentially, by providing you a sentence, your internal processors cross reference the information and provide you the context to fully understand it. Essentially, I provide a topic, I discuss my side, and your automatic information protocols do the rest, providing you with, for lack of a better understanding given your time frame of reference, similar to an academic journal of sources, descriptors, and definitions. Does this make sense?*

"Right, yeah. So, what do I do now?"
