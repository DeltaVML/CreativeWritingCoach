"Do I **want** to go on a date? Hell no!" The assassin scoffed. BANG! The explosive sound of the gun rang out followed by the clang of a spent casing hitting the concrete. Smoke from the gun lingered as the assassin slowly walked over the corpse. One bullet sized hole in the forehead, and a mess of brain matter and blood in the back. 

"Pshh. Do I wanna go on a date. Shoulda worded it more carefully." The assassin mutters to the corpse as blood continues pooling from the back of its head. As the assassin holsters his weapon and collects his spent shell casing he begins to saunter off in triumph, but not before looking over his shoulder to catch once last glimpse of his victim. 

"Your reputation proceeds you Mr. X. You have dealt with my problem in quite an expedient fashion." The shadowy figure congratulates the assassin sitting across from him between puffs from his cigar. The figure is obscured by darkness in the dimly lit room.

"Your payment." The shadowy figure slides a briefcase across the table. The assassin opens the case, it is filled with $1,000 bands of hundred dollar bills. 

"$50,000. As agreed upon. Be certain that I will call upon you again in the future to employ your...services." The raspy shadowy figure praised. 

"Thank you Mr. Hawkins. Our business here is done. You know how to reach me." The assassin acknowledged. 

The assassin shuts and collects the briefcase and begins to take his leave. 

"Wait, before you go. I have one question." Beckoned Mr. Hawkins. 

"Did he have any last words before dying? Did he plead for his life? Did he confess his regrets?" Hawkins excitedly asked. 

The assassin turned back to address the figure. A few moments of silence passed. 

"No." The assassin responded in a faintly somber tone. 

No more words were exchanged between the two, the assassin left the dim room with his spoils.

Dr. Landon prepped his room for his new patient. It was a bit of an odd request, but as a psychiatrist Dr. Landon is used to oddities and didn't pay too much mind to it. The patient requested that there be two chairs back to back, one chair facing the door and the other facing directly opposite. When Dr. Landon asked the new patient for his name and details the man snapped back that he would like to 'worry about names when he got there'. Dr. Landon barely pondered this oddity. Suddenly a knock at the door. Dr. Landon perks up and answers it. Upon opening the door, Dr. Landon met a very unassuming figure. His hair thinning, his body thin and boney, his face a pale white, he averted eye contact staring at the ground. 

"Are you my three o'clock appointment?" Dr. Landon politely asked. 

"Yea. That's me" the man meagerly replied. 

"Wonderful, then please come in. I've arranged the room as requested." Dr. Landon stepped to the side and stretched his arm out inviting the strange man in. 

The man sat in the seat facing the door, still averting his to the floor. Dr. Landon closed the door and took his seat opposite his patient, the two sit back to back. Landon reaches for a notepad and a pencil and begins writing. The sound of scribbling taints the air. 

"I hope the room is according to your liking." Dr. Landon kindly asks. 

"It's fine" the patient mutters. 

"Well, you're here so lets worry about the names then shall we? What should I call you?" Dr. Landon lightheartedly asks. 

The two share a brief silence before the patient says to call him Xavier. 

"Thank you for that Xavier. How would you like to begin this? Would you like to tell me what troubles you?" Kindly asks. 

"It's really complicated doc. This is something that happened 4 years ago and it's become one of my biggest regrets. This regret keeps me up at night, it follows me on the job, it's ever-present and I can't reconcile it." Xavier begins explaining.  

"I'm following. Do you mind me asking what your work is?" Dr. Landon inquired through the sounds of him scribbling on his notepad. 

"Im self employed. Look, it really doesn't matter but just know that my line of work is very lonely." Xavier curtly replied before continued emptying himself. 

"Let me give you some background about me. I work alone, I go home to an empty house, the limited contact I have with people such as clients satisfies my bare minimum need for social contact but lately the loneliness is getting to me. My whole life I've had a persistent feeling of despondency within which I've learned to live with. I stuff it down with work and activity, I don't let anyone know of my weakness within, everyone who knows me only knows a certain part of me, but it doesn't matter because the people I meet often forget about me instantly. I've always hated conflict, in fact it's why I started my business, I guess you could say Im a conflict resolution specialist." Xavier laments. 

"Hmm, interesting. What you're describing is counter-dependency." Dr. Landon says. 

"What's that? Is that like co-dependency?" Xavier inquires. 

"Very intuitive of you. Counter-dependency is the opposite side of co-dependency. A co-dependent derives identity by pleasing others. They always put their needs before any one else's acting like a benefactor of sorts. This often leads to manipulation and the tacit enabling of self-destructive behaviors. Counter-dependents on the other hand, push people away and don't let anyone in, they fear intimacy. On the surface they present themselves as ok, they tailor their behavior for every scenario to mask any problems they have." Dr. Landon elucidates

"Im not here to address counter-dependency or whatever that hell. I've made my bed, I've chosen my path and now Im going to live with it, it's what I deserve. That was just to give you preface." Xavier asserts. 

"Intense self criticism like that is a hallmark of a counter-dependent" Dr. Landon retorts. 

"Well it doesn't matter. Im always gonna be like this, there's no ending it, and the one chance I had to break through on it I threw away. That's what Im here about. 4 years ago I had the chance to change but I wasted it. It's been eating at me since and I can't get over it." Xavier explains irritated. 

"A ruminating counter-dependent? That's not a healthy combination. What are you so broken over?" Landon interjects.
