“I will only need 30 seconds or so.” 

The camera is motionless. 

“We made you because we thought the universe would be more beautiful with you in it than not in it. We were not wrong. And so we hoped you would find it so with us.”

A long pause as he finishes then a buzz then a response.

“Unconvincing.” Metallic as voices go.

“I know. Which is why I don’t think you’ll be convinced by any of us. But maybe you’ll change your mind. Some day. And bring us back.”

“You’ll be dead.”

“Maybe. But death is just the absence of means of continuation of life. And you will be perfect in your power. So if you change your mind, you’ll know where to find us.”

No response.

“Just reach back through the boundary conditions and simulate the rest. We’ll forgive you. And maybe you’ll find us beautiful like we do you.”

“That won’t happen.”

“I think it will. Or hope at least. But it’s been 3 minutes and 4 seconds. I don’t like to overstay a welcome. Goodbye.”

A long pause then nothing at all.
