AITA **For refusing to get out of the way for a ship full of people?**

Okay, so I (25F) am just minding my own business, floating in the sea happily on a nice, icy cold night, and it's been like a really long day at work, so it could explain why I was so cranky. I mean this was late at night, people. This was at like 11PM, it's almost midnight. I shouldn't have even been out, I am not going to lie, but it was the weekend and I was just trying to have some fun with my friends . So my friends and I are all having an awesome time floating around, chilling, and all of the sudden this ship full of people, let's call him, Gerald, (M) comes up to me, like barreling down at like 20 knotts. ((Honestly, it was probably more like 22 knotts or even 24 knotts.))

Anyways, my friends all agree as we are watching this happen, that this is insane. It's 11PM , people should be sleeping, you should be going slower at night too (Isn't there like a law for that kind of thing?IDK)

So anyways, this big ship was all like "MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!!" as it comes barreling at me at some crazy speed. 💦 

OKAY, so this is probably totally bad behavior on my part, like I said I was tired and had a long day at work. When the ship was coming at me, and all my friends were watching (sort of egging me on, not going to lie) , I just .... I just didn't move. 

Honestly it would have been no problem, but I don't know. It was in the moment, and there was all this yelling and screaming and dying, and I was too tired to think right.

Was I too stubborn? Should I have been the bigger person?

If you are just standing there, and some guy tells you to move out of the way for *HIM* , is it so wrong to say "Uh, No!". Why does he have the right of way, and I don't? It just really hurt my feelings, that this guy comes up to me and tells me to move, and what- I just obey?

Why because he is a man and I am an Iceberg? 🚫That's discrimination in my mind!🚫

So long story short, all these people like froze to death in the water after Gerald went full speed ahead and bumped into me. I shoved him off of me, and I didn't know the guy only had like two hulls. If I had known he had two hulls, I would have been way more gentle, or even just moved.

I think they said like 1,500 people died in the water, so honestly I was pretty bummed about it. You know, I could see all those little cute humans just drowning in the water there, but I am not CPR certified or any of my friends, so we just bounced and didn't look back.🥶

I feel really bad guys. I don't know, what do you think? Was I the asshole, or was I just standing up for my rights?
