That Bruce Wayne guy had the right idea. He was afraid of bats, so he dressed up as bats. Good shit, I say.

My childhood friend was afraid of his alcoholic father, so he drinks to cope with his childhood.

Jfk said, "the only thing we have to fear... is fear itself." What a good quote. Imagine an anti-hero that breaks down villians with the fear they inject to him. You're probably thinking "Badass," with a capital B.

Have you ever rescued a stray animal from the street or took care of a flower that somehow bloomed in concrete. How is it that they go from being evolution's finest in the harshest conditions to being dead from me trying to rescue them?

My parents were role models of people who hate children. As much as I try to lead a different path than them, I know that the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. The yelling and beatings are too ingrained into my memories to not recreate in impatience. I thought I could be different but I couldn't help but constantly go back to the attitude I saw as a child.

So why is it that my brother's car crash left me with a child to raise?
