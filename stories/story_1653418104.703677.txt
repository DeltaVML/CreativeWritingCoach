[1/2]

My dad handled my **Instructions** in the same way he had always handled everything in his life. With absolutely zero nuance, and without asking a single follow-up question. 


It wasn’t his fault. Dad had told me many times that the only way things didn’t go absolutely downhill for him in life was when he followed the rules without any questions or overthinking. Which was probably a good thing in his case, otherwise he would’ve ended all life on earth with his powers of molten nuclear destruction.
 

But my dad carried the manual with his **Instructions** always in his pocket. It’s as thick as a phonebook, and he’s been thumbing through that thing for as long as I could remember.  The pages had long since become worn and wrinkled from constant use. He knows all of it by heart - every letter, every line, every stipulation, safety measure and footnote. I’m pretty sure he even has the table of contents memorized. 


Which is why it was a little bit insulting, when he decided that the best way for me to memorize my own **Instructions** - a four word sentence, keep in mind - is for him to make me a bracelet with the phrase to wear on my wrist for as long as I live. 


“Just humor him, darling.” my other dad said to me, granting me a rare bowl of afternoon ice-cream along with a fond smile. The ceramic felt extra frosty from his icy touch, “You know how he worries.”


I did know. I did understand. I understood even better with the Owl sitting next to me. It was a manifestation of wisdom, I later found out, which I’d created without even trying. I was more insightful while it existed, and it helped me understand the world with the acumen unbefitting a confused fourteen year old with knobby knees and awkward elbows. 

I’m not sure why the Owl was the first thing I made. I was just angry and confused - already upset by the lack of instructions regarding my powers, and now also insulted by my brilliant father’s lack of trust - and the Owl showed up, as though to help me understand. 

That’s why, even though I hated it with all my heart, I accepted the bracelet when dad emerged from his workshop. I put it on my wrist without complaining and stared miserably at the four words I was supposed to live by:

Don’t heed the Cat.

I looked at the Owl next to me - owls were kind of like bird-cats. But it just blinked back at me with huge, round eyes.  

And so began my life with my Animal Guides. 

The Cat didn’t show up for a long time. I waited for it every day, knowing that it would probably pop up the same way all the others did - when the situation demanded it, or I was in desperate need of its abilities. 

That’s how it went with the others, at least. I didn’t have clear instructions on what to do, like most people, so everything played out through instinct and gut-feelings. 

I won my first school race with the Cheetah running by my side. I aced every test with the Owl on my shoulder. I stood up to my childhood bully with the Lion looming at my back. When I was with my friends, the goofy little Monkey would clamber things near me, making me feel giddy and making it easier for everyone to like me. And when I was feeling sad, the Dog would plant its scruffy head in my lap and look at me with big, soulful eyes, offering unconditional love and understanding. The Dog made me emotionally robust and helped me handle loneliness.  

Nobody could see my animals, so it was a little bit like cheating my way through life. My dads tried to discourage me from using them too much, but eventually they gave up. It’s not like I had much control over when they’d show up, and other kids my age liberally used their power wherever they could. 

It all went along somehow, and became a normal part of my life, but I always kept wondering about the Cat. 

What was it for? When could I need it? What could it give me, and why was it forbidden? 

I got the answer on the day of my 21st birthday. 

It probably wasn’t an accident that my regular assessment was on that day. I showed up at my counselor’s office bright and early and planted myself into the plastic chair by her desk. The Lion sprawled on the floor next to me, shrinking the space of the tiny office even more. 

“Good morning, Liam.” Mrs. Peterson was deeply focused on my file, like always, “Which one is joining us for this meeting?” 

“The Lion.” I replied. It had never occurred to me to even try to hide it, even though I hated the way she narrowed her eyes at me.  

“Oh? Are you nervous?” Mrs. Peterson was smug, like she cracked some kind of complicated code. 

“No.” it came out defensive. I didn’t want it to. But it was like that thing where you see a police car and try not to act suspicious, even though you’ve done nothing wrong. 

“Then why the Lion?” 

“I don’t know, why so nosy?” is what went through my head, but what I blurted out was sadly the truth, “I’m actually going to ask someone out today. I’ve liked them for a long time, so I guess I needed the courage.” 

“Oh.” Mrs. Peterson’s entire face shriveled in disgust at something as plain as normal human interactions. She sniffed and click-clacked something down at her laptop, “Has everything been normal since our last meeting?” 

“Yes.” 

“No sign of the Cat?” 

“No, no Cat.” 

Clickity-clacking continued, less enthusiastic, for a minute. She finished and finally looked up at me and her face did a thing. 

Holy shit, what is that? 

“Now, Liam,” Mrs. Peterson said, as I came to a reeling realization that she was smiling. It was the most horrible leathery smile I’ve ever seen, “you’re at that age when you should start considering your future.” 

“Yeah.” I said, staring at her teeth, “I mean- yes. I don’t know if college is for me, but-” 

“We here at Jötunn Corp. feel that you would be an excellent addition to our executive offices.” Mrs. Peterson’s teeth said, “You’ve got very unique, adaptable abilities that could be really polished into a shining diamond in our care.” 

“They…could?” 

“Of course! We know you’ve been using your Enhancers as crutches to get by in everyday life - and there’s nothing wrong with that.” she said, a bit too quickly not to be rehearsed, “But imagine if you trained? Imagine if you unlocked things you couldn’t even dream of? What if you could have a Bear give you incredible strength? Imagine if you had a Hawk that could make you fly!” 

“I don’t know about flying, I’m not good with heights.” 

“That’s beside the point, Liam.” her tone turned razor-sharp within an instant. She stabbed a blue flier in my direction. The surface was a deep indigo, with an emblem in the corner depicting three white birds taking flight, “Don’t let your gift waste away. You could do great things with us.” 

“You should totally knock that ugly mug off her desk.” said something small and black, perched on the arm of my chair. 

I looked down at the ugliest yellow mug I’d ever seen in my life. My hand moved without my input and I swung hard, slapping the atrocity off the desk and onto the tiled floor.
