*30 minutes... or at least it should be provided Boris made good on his timing.*

*The gentle thrum of magic suppression circles managed to block out the soft pitter patter of elegant shoes on the dungeon's cold stone floor. I was deep in my thoughts, meditating with the question yanked me abruptly back to reality*.

**"Why are people rebelling against my rule?"**

*Though surprised, I do my best to maintain my composure. Though the circles prevent any external casting. Nothing is stopping me from simply channelling magic internally. The prisoner's body I had allowed to my appearance to become disappears, replaced with the temple I had chiselled myself into. I would not appear weak when faced with the object of my hate.*  

"Are you asking because you do not know? Or because you want to make a point?"

**"The former."** She said coldly. **"Co-operate here and I may consider sparing you."**

"And how many others have you asked this very same line of questioning?"

**"38, though all refused to even speak. You are the first to even engage in conversation."**

"I see. Why do you think they refused to speak to you?"

**"Are you asking this line of questions to have me arrive at the answer to my first question?"**

"That is my hope, yes."

**"Very well... Perhaps these individuals thought there was honour in silence. Perhaps they didn't want to risk revealing any other information to me."** *As she speculated I could see the metaphoric gears turning in her head, she hadn't even thought to question these things before.*

"From what social class has the rebellion mainly formed?"

*There was a twitch in her otherwise porcelain face. A truth she had been trying to avoid thinking about.* **"M-mainly the peasantry and the workforce"** *Her demeanour had changed, she was uncomfortable. The gears had gotten caught on some metaphoric thread.*

**"But that's only because the casting elite had turned them against themselves, if they had been willing to peacefully surrender we wouldn't have this issue!"** She's gone from cold to flustered in a heartbeat. Guess she is as neurotic as the propaganda from the other kingdom said.

"What caused you to stammer and get flustered there?" *I probed further, plainly toned hoping to draw this conversation more while still making it look like I was 'co-operating'.*

**"Your questions are uncomfortable to hear."** She admitted going back to her porcelain pristine personality. *It would make sense that most people would be on the throne wouldn't be flustered that easily. But admitting that in a conversation? I suppose she's banking in my dying in 25 minutes. Hopefully the plan will resolve that issue.*

"I see..." *I allowed a brief pause to break off the subject tonally.*

"Returning to the topic at hand" *I said as if nothing was amiss* "During your initial rise to power through what means did you cement that power?"

**"The public backing of the populous at large, promises we intend to keep about ending starvation. Bread and circuses at it were."**

*We were getting close to the source of the issue, and close to the time for the plan to go off. With her being here and the weapon set to trace her unique signal the only way she'd survive a successful strike is if she was in this anti-magic circle I'm in... maybe I can secure both a bargaining chip and a PR victory here...*

"I see. Now imagine for a moment that you were living a somewhat miserable but certainly liveable life, But along comes a regime that promises you a 'fair share' of the kingdom's wealth. Makes claims about the current ruling elite who were annoying to deal with but not actively malicious about their money and power being stolen from you 'the people'."

"These people get into power and for a while everything looks good, you're able to grow your farm well, get a good few harvests in and the taxmen don't visit as often."

*I pause for dramatic effect, building tension which the silence*

"But, as all good things do this comes to an end once your 3rd good harvest comes through. Suddenly a small armada is at your door berating you and saying that you're one of those greedy hoarding elites who selfishly keep all the food to yourself. You point out that you offer your produce at a reasonable rate and they start going on a tirade about how you're "not doing your part for the community" and demonising you to your friends, family, churches you name it" 

"They start taking your produce by force at this point. At sword point if you don't 'willingly'" *I make a gesture of air quotes* "and then you find out that you're not the only one they treated like this. A letter in the mail, an observation from across the street. The people they claimed to represent and work for being stolen from all saying the same message. 'These people lied to us, they think they're so damn clever, how about we teach them a lesson?'".

*The room was once again filled with silence.* 

**"I think I see the point you're trying to make. It does not sway me however. Enjoy your last few minutes of life"**

"And you enjoy your last few seconds" '*And zero' I smirked as 5000 gigacasts of divine retribution ripped through the building I occupied. The only reason I survived? Well it's the very thing that stopped me from tearing this place to the ground. The anti magic circles.*

*Once the dust had cleared I saw that the chains that bound me had broken. I stood up. Walked free of the circle and materialised suitable clothing for myself. Any traces of that psuedo-royal brat had vanished along with all of C block. My smirk turned into a grin as I looked for my comrades.*

*About 600 blinks away (at a rough guess) was the tell-tale white hot glow of a Prismatic Latticed Orichalcum Teleporter after being used to send high grade ontological fission materials that were in the middle of activating. I gave them our salute and continued the mission.*
