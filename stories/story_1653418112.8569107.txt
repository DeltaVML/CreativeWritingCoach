Am I the asshole for trying to redistribute wealth?

In America, we have so many rich people that hoard so much money, that if you earned 100 dollars a day since the day Jesus was born, you still wouldn't have as much money as Jeff Bezos.

Elon Musk bought Twitter for about 44-45 BILLION dollars. That amount, if given to every single American as per the US census bureau in 2022, would be about $135 dollars. For a purchase that could be argued was solely based out of either boredom, or to protect his fragile fragile ego. 

We have mothers struggling to feed their children formula nationwide, where more and more states are rolling back abortion laws forcing more women to have children they don't want. This is all done to perpetuate the religious compound that exists within America: neglected children are a breeding ground for churches, making unwanted forced term pregnancies a valuable source of future income. You can't sustain religion if you're not having kids, and you can't make it out of poverty if you're forced to take care of some human you don't want and bestowed consciousness on without consent. 

We have bridges collapsing and tarnished water in cities. We have people buying jets and multiple car garages while having the lower class rely on busses and metros to survive, and forced to never thrive.

I'm done pretending this is all on accident, and that the majority of these poor people are lazy; IMO if you believe that you're more disconnected than I thought. 

We need a massive revolutionary redistribution of the wealth of the 1% to be redistributed among all Americans so ALL can benefit. There's no need for mega yachts that can hold world ending parties on them while politicians and wealthy people alike suck the very teet of the person they allow to have that much money.

I could very well be the asshole, but am i? For only wanting a better life for all Americans by taxing the rich on income they don't NEED?
