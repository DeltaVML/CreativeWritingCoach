[...So~o, that's  your proposal? —asked the god of creation and destruction Urkud] 

[Indeed—Brightly aswered Rukud, his youngest brother and God of Caos— , I've seen mortals doing it. For a mortal week, the minor gods will take a corresponding  place on the pantheon  and we the greater gods do the same with their jobs. This is an exercise  of bonding, so we can understand  better  our duties  with this quick post swap.]

[Ummm—the goddes of love, Laramie, thought to her self about the proposal  of his  cousin, and remembering her son's job.— I think i quite like the idea]

And slowly, every  greater god, from war to health agreed with the youngling. The final word was to be expected from Urkud.

[After some thought (and convincement from my wife), we all agree to participate in this "Organizational awareness " thing.]
