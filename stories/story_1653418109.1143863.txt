He is stronger than me. Faster than me. And while my ability to influence people with music is strong, there are limits to what I can do.

He turns to face my city. Mine. Neighbors, friends, hell, even my enemies lives have meaning. He’s going to destroy it all, and I have only one option left; one that will take us both out of the equation forever.

With trembling hands, I reach towards the player knob, and select the “do not select” setting.

He turns, contemptuous, but as the music begins to play, his smile melts into a dawning realization.

“This is the song that never ends..”

Eternity awaits.
