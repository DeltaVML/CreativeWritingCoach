The target laid prone, unable to respond to the swift ambush. Taking out her mall-cop guards was a cinch, at least it was, for someone who has been in this grim industry for years.

Still, with great experience, comes a great sense of professionalism... and tradition. The target was marked simply through no fault of her own -- she was simply born in the wrong clan, at the wrong time and in the wrong place.

Tradition demanded that that she was offered a final request.

“As a courtesy, I’ll give you one final request. Anything within my power.”

Dazed, she could barely respond. The poor girl was probably still processing the gravity of the situation. Her expression cycled from bewilderment, to desperation, and finally, to resignation.

She stammered, “Wanna go on a date?”

She was not an unattractive girl, mind you. Indeed, by all accounts, her files noted that she was an oddity among her clan -- kind and gentle, albeit fairly reserved.

On the other hand, professionalism trumped tradition.

There was a barely audible apology as the assassin quickly smothered her life out, as a gesture of mercy... and regret.
