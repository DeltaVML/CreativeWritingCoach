I heard the blow, Magnum Fists uppercut smashing against my chestplate, the bevor tearing free with a noise like an aluminum bat making a line drive, and my helmet peeling off as I barely pulled away in time to keep my head attached.

Suddenly, all the noise and music inside my head evaporated as the speakers that had been resting on my temples left with the rest of the helmet, my vision almost vanishing from half a dozen cuts from all that material being buckled like tinfoil, leaving an opaque crimson mess across my face and eyes.

And without that music, I couldn't come close to dodging the follow-up swing, catching me square in the nose and... that's the last thing I remember. Suit telemetry recorded some momentary g-forces around 250, lots of spinning, and loss of most systems except for the main armored shell.

As soon as the sensors stopped detecting any vitals, the reinforced spine plate started pinging, hollow notes... a piano of metal joined a moment later by a violin or humming broadcast by the same. Volume built until Magnum Fists heard it, and a moment later he laughed as he heard the first words:

"**Just one more time before I go, I'll let you know... that all this time I've been afraid to let it show... nobody can save me now...**"

Muffling the noise with the remains of a car punched over to land on top of me, a moment later he turns when that same car flies away, tumbling like a thrown knife before splattering against the wall beside him in a decent impression of childishly thrown spaghetti.

My jaw is still re-assembling itself, as is my left arm. I'm a mess, no question, but the last thing Magnum Fist hears just before tumbling through a parking garage and skipping across the lake like a stone, "**Nobody can save you now...**"

Two minutes later, there's a zig-zagging line several miles long as my regenerating corpse pinballed Magnum Fist half-way up the mountain, that metal brace on my spine slowing finally, and the deathly silence of a terrified forest after a natural disaster creeping in.

I fell over face-first into the churned dirt all around me, that metal backplate slowly plucking out a final set of noises like a silver-stringed guitar, dents and collateral damage from the carnage I unleashed leaving the lyrics like a chain-smoker's first time at the mic: "**One dark and stormy night, a fledgling fell from flight...**"

By the time the recovery team had arrived, I was sitting naked beside the charred crater, the remains of my suit vaporized in the column of fire that shot up into the sky half an hour ago.

"So... how bad?" is all I ask as the ATVs roll up the last ruts in the land I'd torn up.

"Somehow... nobody dead from you, let's get you back in containment though," they say, holding up a set of noise-canceling earmuffs which I gladly slip on to silence the world from me for the ride back into civilization.
