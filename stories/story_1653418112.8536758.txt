AITA for trying to help a woman get out of an abusive relationship?

So basically I have this work rival and he shows all the signs of being an abuser. He punches holes in walls, he is very full of himself, he seems so unfeeling I'd say like a brick wall, but honestly more like titanium. And he has this crazy death stare he can give sometimes.

Anyway, due to work out personal lives are unfortunately also intertwined. After doing some thinking I decided to pick up his girlfriend for some tea and try to really change her mind about her relationship with him.

Then waddaya know, this dude literally busts my door down (after assaulting my groundskeepers!) And rushes her away before she would even have a chance to protest. Classic abusive relationship stuff.

Yet for some reason most of the people we know always take his side on things

AITA?
