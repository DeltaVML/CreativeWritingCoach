(Arc 6, Interlude 2: The Sunrise Court)

(Note: Bargain Bin Superheroes is episodic; each part is self-contained. This story can be enjoyed without reading the previous sections.)

**He had been a minor noble, all things considered.** The Kuiper Lord was one of the newer subjects of the Sunrise King, only recently elevated to lordship and the associated powers and responsibilities. He had thought that his new astral abilities came at no cost, that he would be able to sling spells of the void no matter what choices he made, or what oaths he broke.

He was, unfortunately for him, wrong.

The Kuiper Lord knelt before the Sunrise King—as it should be, as it had to be, as it always would be. The planets orbited the sun; the nobility orbited the king. That was the way of things; breaking from that path had costs. Costs that the Kuiper Lord was only now discovering.

"When I rode to do battle against a nation foreign and corrupt, my nobles followed suit," the Sunrise King began. "The Moon Commander called the House of Light to our side; the Mars Prince marshaled our fleets to war; and I stood at the center of it all, burning at the fulcrum of all things, as I must. As I *am*. And when I granted you the title of the Kuiper Lord, you swore the oaths that would give you your power."

"I did," the Kuiper Lord gasped, "and I strayed from your path. For this I apologize, my king. I beg your mercy."

Something within the Sunrise King, something that used to be human in an age gone by, wanted to acquiesce with his wayward noble's request. But the Sunrise King was chained by the same nature his lesser nobles were. He had to honor the rules that governed his being, lest his powers slip from his grasp.

"When a comet falls from orbit," the Sunrise King whispered, "does the sun show mercy?"

The Kuiper Lord blanched. "My king—"

"Or does the sun swallow it whole, leaving no trace it had ever existed in the first place?" The Sunrise King *stood*, crimson robes billowing like blood, and a second dawn broke as the Kuiper Lord cried out. Desperately, he called upon his nature—silent space, drifting rocks uncountable distances apart—but the Sunrise King whispered "*Pull*," and the gravity of a hungry star dragged the Kuiper Lord towards a waiting fist. 

The Sunrise King leaned in close to the Kuiper Lord, until his breath tickled the terrified man's ear, and he whispered, "I have clashed with far worthier foes than you today alone, and there are greater challenges to my rule ahead. You have wasted my time in life; let the fuel in your bones serve my ends in your death."

As the Kuiper Lord gibbered in fear, the Sunrise King spoke a single word.

"*Fuse.*"

The atoms in the Kuiper Lord's body imploded, the almighty pressure of the core of a star compressing him into a point no larger than the head of a pin. The Sunrise King tucked the fusion core into his pocket and turned to face his navy.

"Let this be a lesson to all of you!" The Sunrise King shone for all his court to see. "Honor your nature, and you shall become divinity! Break from the paths your astral bodies trace, and you shall find no mercy save for that of the void!"

And that path was to follow him, until the stars burned cold and the Earth was long dead.
