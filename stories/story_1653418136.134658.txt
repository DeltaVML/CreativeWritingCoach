My father's brother asked my mother if he could take me out and teach me how to fish. My mom was excited that he would want anything to do with me, especially since I was obviously his child. (My father had been infertile since birth.) After being traumatized by this man over, and over, I felt my powers come to life, and couldn't help but ask him, "does it burn? Does it feel like you're being split in half, you worthless piece of shit?"

That's what it felt like for me, and I hope that my powers over slowing down time to make it feel the same way for him.
