As I sent the email asking for Morgan to print out the documents for the day, making up the excuse that our printer had stopped working, the elevator doors opened. I had written on the WhatsApp group for our team that I wanted to have breakfast all-together. Following the plan, everyone said they couldn't do it, but the impossible seemed to happen once again.

"Morning boss." the pale woman spoke, her strange purple eyes glistening against the beams of sunlight that intruded through the blinds of the office.

"M-morning..." I responded, perplexed. She was not the type to refuse to comply with the requests of the team, or my instructions as her superior, but it was impossible that she had managed to complete both her tasks in the minimal amount of time that I had given her.

"The copies and documents are on the personal printer I have on my desk, and the food is arriving in 5 minutes, should be here before most of the team as well."

The clock had struck 9am sharp, not a single extra or late second, as the doors to the elevator opened. She complied and succeeded far beyond anyone else to do everything in her contract.

After she got the documents and the food placed on my desk, I stared at it all in awe, and then shifted my gaze at her.

"I don't understand how you do it... Morgana."

"Do what, boss?"

"Get here on time every single day. You never leave earlier or later than 5pm yet your work is... always finished."

"It's in my contract sir. It's what I do."

"But you do it so well. It's kind of magical really."

Morgan raised one of her eyebrows and I suddenly felt a rush. A strange sensation washed over me as she walked towards me.

"I don't comply *so well*, sir. I do it **to the letter**. I take contracts very seriously."

"I can tell, maybe we should update your contract to give you some more things to do, huh? Add a little extra so we have our best worker on more projects."

"I believe I'm okay with the level of authority and involvement I have here, sir. I rather not get a managerial position. I'm afraid the power gets to my head and I am not *myself*."

"If you say so... but, you have to promise me something," I extended my hand towards her, and she looked at it with a hint of mischief that I didn't understand. "you can only leave if I'm gone too, deal?"

She smirked, taking my hand into her own.

"It's a deal. Signed and bonded, but you should probably be more specific next time, eh boss?"

&amp;#x200B;

In hindsight, I should have known that something was wrong. She looked too much like some of the original workers, and it didn't make sense that 5 generations had worked with us by now. 

In hindsight, I should have been more specific with what I meant as I said she could leave once I was **gone**. And, maybe, I should have realized the importance of promises earlier, as I slowly felt myself drift away, she caressed my cheek. 

"Thanks, boss. I had been waiting a *long* time to leave."
