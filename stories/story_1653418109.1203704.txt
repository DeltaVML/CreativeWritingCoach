Blood and teeth on the floor. Vinyl discs stuck from every surface. Speakers broken and my mic stand twisted. I'm out of options. 

MAX RADIUM gloats over my broken and failing body. He thinks he's won. Blind to my trembling efforts he cackles while I slip a hand to my headphones.

"Sound canceling on."

All my life, sound put power into me. My Chemical Romance summoned skeletons. Saint Motel shot light from my hands. Even little things gave momentary powers. I'd fought villain after villain with headphones thumping in my ears. The years had shown the public all of my moves. Save for one. 

Silence. and with it the strongest I can ever be. The complete absence of sound summons the power of "Unmaking".

It didn't matter that MAX RADIUM was coming to finish me off. I couldnt hear his footsteps and neither could he. Muted questions. Voiceless rage. I'm saved from a faster death by his skin starting to boil.

I stared from the floor, watching my strongest foe slow and melt. His features sagged. Bones and sinew liquified before the meat around them. He screamed. They always do. No one heard the gurgling sludge he became.
