PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I was naive to think that lives could only be saved through healing and to think healing was a noble art.
  

  
Ever since I was a child, I wanted to save lives. I grew up at the wrong time. Before I could learn healing magic, many healing temples had been put under scrutiny by the government. Healing had been used for evil.
  

  
The most feared mage in the land was not a pyromancer, nor a necromancer, but a healer. He regenerated parts of the body to the point of excess, causing malignant growths and cancers. He had a hoard of prisoners which he kept alive for harvesting, removing their organs, and regrowing them over and over. He multiplied invasive plants to ruin harvests, was a master of pain, and had become a message for others not to underestimate healers.
  

  
One day, my future was bright, the next, it was all but a fantasy. I could not learn healing magic, but I promised myself that I would find a way to help people.
  

  
Few forms of magic lend themselves well for healing. Not charms, transfiguration, or energy manipulation. But death… death was the opposite school of magic of life. I soon realized they were one of the same. It was the only type of magic I hadn’t tried, the moment I cast my first death spell, I could feel the reversal of life magic, the same magic twisted to its corrupted counterpart. If a healer could harm, perhaps a death mage could heal.
  

  
Spells meant to share pain between two people could also be used to share healing. Spells meant to kill warriors could also be used to kill diseases. Spells meant to manipulate spirits could be used to help them find peace. Finally, I had found a way to save lives.
  

  
Though in recent days the most feared healer has been increasing their carnage. All of my spellwork has been simply to try to undo his vile deeds. I must wipe out the source of this hurt. So now, I stand before the dark healer’s tower, prepared to use death magic to snuff out life. I will heal this land by curing it of its plagues. Even if I must kill a healer to do it.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opening paragraph is well-written and engaging. You set up the story nicely and introduce the reader to the conflict. However, the second paragraph feels a bit choppy and could be reorganized for better flow. In addition, the third paragraph introduces the antagonist without much context or explanation. It might be helpful to provide more information about who this "feared healer" is and why they are feared.

The fourth paragraph is well-written and provides good background information about the protagonist. However, the fifth paragraph feels a bit abrupt and could be expanded upon. In addition, the sixth paragraph introduces the solution to the protagonist's problem without much explanation. It might be helpful to provide more information about how the protagonist came to this conclusion and why they think it will work.

The seventh paragraph is well-written and provides good detail about the protagonist's plan. However, the eighth paragraph feels a bit rushed and could be expanded upon. In addition, the ninth paragraph introduces the climax of the story without much context or explanation. It might be helpful to provide more information about what the protagonist is hoping to accomplish and why they are willing to risk everything to do it.

In general, the story is well-written and engaging. However, it feels a bit choppy in places and could use more development. The characters are interesting and the plot is unique. I look forward to seeing more from you!
