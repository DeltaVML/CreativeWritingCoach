PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

It was fairly early on a Tuesday morning so I was in my usual spot of leaning on a broom just out of sight of the registers.  If Mr. Henley walked my direction it'd be easy enough to start pantomiming sweeping, but otherwise there was very little to do until the rush when people got off work at the quarry.  Until then it was either lean on a broom or count the cans of tomato soup again. There were still 37 of those by last count, so today I was leaning on the broom.

"Now, Our Shep," Henley spoke up from around the corner, "What manner of contraption do ya kin that to be?"

Mr. Henley is my boss and the owner of the only grocery store in town. The only, well, any store in town, in fact. The place was just called "Store" as it didn't need another name. If you needed gas, a wedding dress, or a frozen turkey there was only one place to get it. Much like how the post office didn't need its own name either.  As best we can tell, Mr. Henley is from right here in Ascalon which makes his eccentric patois all the more incomprehensible. Everyone is either an "Our" or "His" in his world. You are either "Our David" or "His David." He's never clarified who this mythical male who seems to own half the town might be. But, using some internal logic that no one else can decipher, he wants everyone, even the person he is addressing, to know which David, Paul, or Shepherd - that's me by the way - he is talking about so we don't mix it up with that other guys.  Considering Henley has been set in his ways since roughly the time steam engines were considered the next big thing, we just stopped arguing with him about it.

I made a big production of coming out of the aisle while sweeping and shot him a look like he was interrupting my diligence. I needn't have bothered. He only had eyes for the vehicle pulling up to the empty parking lot in front of Store. I took one look at the chrome finished RV with its myriad of antenna and his and her kayaks strapped to the roof and my heart fell.

"Oh no," I moaned, "Glampers!"

"Whazzat?" Henley asked, "Cankers?" 

I didn't really feel a point in correcting him there. I didn't really have time as the doors flew open to reveal the L.L. Bean interior and a man and woman wearing brand new flannel shirts, designer vests, and designer hiking shoes never intended to touch dirt leaped out and started walking towards the door. This was bad.  This was very bad.

The only road that leads into or out of our little mountain town is Route No. 9.  According to my grandfather, they followed a snake while paving the road and had to stop once it broke it's back three times trying to make the turns. Grandpa, however, was prone to exaggeration so it was probably only two times. What I am trying to say is the road is narrow, winding, and follows a path of steep up and down hills that no sane person who had a choice would ever voluntarily follow if they didn't have to.  Due to our relative inaccessibility, Mr. Henley had yet to meet this bizarre species of moisturizing not so rough and tumble folks who wanted to bring a touch of the Marriott to the great outdoors. Steep learning curve on both sides coming up, I thought.

The bell tinkled as the man stepped inside first. He was tall, fit in a twice a week in the gym/spa sort of way, and handsome. Something about him just shouted he worked in a bank and lost other people's money for them in idiotic investments. The woman who followed him was short, blonde, and probably stored inside a glass case when he didn't take her out to impress his friends.  Mr. Henley watched both of them from the cash register and scowled. There was something about them he didn't like. I could tell without looking they were now His Yuppies.

"Good morning, sir," the stranger boomed as if he were talking to a particularly lifelike statue, "Can you tell us where we are?"

Henley regarded them coldly for all of three seconds before replying.

"Well, young man," he said, drawing out each word like a razor across a barber's strop, "This here is called a 'grocery store.'"

The strange man blinked slowly. To me, the message couldn't be clearer if Mr. Henley had shoved them both out the door, pointed back to the highway, then locked the door and killed the lights.  You are not welcome here.  This, apparently, was a foreign concept to the man so  he, naturally, decided Mr. Henley must be the moron in this exchange and tried again.

"No," he said, "I mean what's the name of the town? I can't find it on the GPS ."

"Is that right?" Mr. Henley replied.  He didn't volunteer anything else. From somewhere else in the store I heard another voice - also male but both much louder and deeper - announce, "Look!  La Choy! It's like an entire supper in a can!"

Uh oh.  I had forgotten Tuesdays were Dylan's shopping days. This was definitely bad news.

I could only stare helplessly and around the corner came Dylan. All twelve feet of him.  He had to bend his serpentine neck almost double to keep his horned head

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening paragraph is good. It sets the scene and introduces the reader to the protagonist. However, the second paragraph is confusing and difficult to follow. I suggest breaking it up into shorter, easier to digest sentences.

The third paragraph is better. It is clear and concise. However, the fourth paragraph is confusing. I suggest breaking it up into shorter sentences.

The fifth paragraph is good. It is clear and concise. However, the sixth paragraph is confusing. I suggest breaking it up into shorter sentences.

In general, I suggest breaking up your paragraphs into shorter, easier to read sentences. This will make your story easier to follow and more enjoyable to read.
