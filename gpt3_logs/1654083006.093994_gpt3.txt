PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Hero. It’s a word that burns my ears every time I hear it. Nobody claims this title for themselves; they have it thrust upon them by the lazy masses who really mean to say “save me”, “do more for me,” “sacrifice yourself for *me*.” They trail behind me like lost children, singing my praises. It makes me sick.

I would never say that aloud, of course. In this whole rotten world my father and sister have been my only allies. Dishonor on my part would tarnish their name and bring them still more suffering. So now you understand my plight; to escape this hell through an honorable death in battle.

There’s just one problem. I’ve tried five times now and I’m still counted amongst the living.

I first thought to fight the Great Beast of Humes in the north. It was a vicious flying thing decorated with scars of its past victories. By the time I arrived there was already a congregation of wannabes with similar thoughts, though none were brave enough to actually follow through with it.

I had to make a good show of things so as not to arouse suspicion so I swung my blade carelessly as I charged. As luck would have it the angry beast’s head came clean off and just like that I was first bestowed that dreadful title.

Hero.

The ragtag band of do-nothings has followed me from one lair to another ever since in spite of my protests. They’ve even given themselves a name now: the Knights of the Red Sun. They even have a crest and play dress up. How trite.

Next is the Emerald Wyrm of the Frozen East. Perhaps this time I will find peace, or I shall return to write again so as to seem too busy for these cretins’ loathsome conversation…

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

RESPONSE:

================================

Your story has a strong, compelling voice and an interesting premise. I would suggest, however, that you focus on developing your characters more fully and creating more tension and conflict in your plot. Additionally, your story could benefit from some description and sensory detail to bring readers more fully into the world you've created.

For example, in the opening paragraph, you could describe the speaker's reaction to hearing the word "hero" in more detail. What does it look like when the speaker gets sick? What does the speaker think about the people who follow him or her?

 Additionally, you might want to create more tension in the second paragraph by showing us what the speaker is thinking as he or she tries to escape the followers. What are the speaker's options? What is the speaker's ultimate goal?

Keep up the good work!
