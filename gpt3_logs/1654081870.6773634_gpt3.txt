PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

When I was turning 14 my Father passed away. I've asked my Mother how he died so many times, but she only tells me he was a brave man. Trying the best I can on nights like these, dark, raining, flashes of lightning illuminating silhouettes, I still can't remember that night. 

Everyone knows the night before your 14th birthday you get your set of instructions to be able to use your powers. They are long dreary rules and habits that you must follow to have your powers. It also doesn't help they're written in lawyer speech, like terms and services, also commanding pages upon pages of these terms to follow. Lastly, they're like volunteer work. Always good natured and sometimes making you go out of your way to fulfill them.

This has coined their names as Saints, but largely they're made fun of because the powers they grant are seemingly useless. Such as, others can't speak when you are, while you're reading you won't walk into anything; Strange but absolute powers while you're doing a task.

Now, while thunder peels back the silence of the night, I'm reminded of my theory that someone had to pay a cost to give a  message to certain people. If you didn't want to give powers to the wrong people, but also weren't allowed to only give it to select people, you'd make the rules ridiculous, long, and tedious, so only those who truly strove for them could use them.

But I've always found that short, punctual messages made more of an impact. Single words can hold such power, depending on the context. Kill, Run, Catch Them, Survive. They hold so much more meaning when they're not covered in so many words.

Now, I'm 30, balding, and work as a night guard at a children's home. I'm also a Saint, but I laugh when people joke about all the things I must do. Because after my dad died, I've had my powers everyday. When I shut something, only I can open it.

As I look out a 2nd story window, I see him there tonight as well. Asking in his voice, with his image, if he could see the kids and congratulate them on what they'll have. He's with so many others, looking in the window I shut hours prior to this. I've always wanted to see my dad again, but not like this. When the lightning flashes, the silhouettes have horns and wings.

Someone had to be sending me a message, and I will follow these words until I die.

Don't let Them in.

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

RESPONSE:

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, your opening sentence is a bit choppy and could be revised for clarity. Additionally, your use of description is sometimes helpful but at other times it feels like you are trying too hard to be poetic and it takes away from the story. Lastly, your dialogue could be more natural and less stilted. Overall, there is a lot of potential in your story and with some revision it could be truly excellent.
