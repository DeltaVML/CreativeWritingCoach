PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

With the sudden and indeed quite violent in some cases return of magic across the globe you may suddenly find people close to you, friends, family or otherwise, developing powers beyond mortal reckoning. Siblings in particular are a tough case due to the natural tendency of magic to follow old mythical archetypes, manipulating and escalate sibling rivalries with sometimes fatal results. This Archetypal Personality Corruption Disorder(APCD) may seem to be a force beyond human ability to defeat but it is in function a mental illness which can have its worst impacts mitigated by a solid support network for the afflicted and proper understanding of the disorder and the circumstances of the afflicted. It is important to note however no matter how terrifying a witch's control over reality is or how much they may seem to be different from who they once were they are at their core the same sister or in very rare instances brother they were before, and so long as you don't let the mind clouding effects of magic make you forget that you will find it shockingly simple to settle into this new life. Still, some things are to be kept in mind to prevent possible archetypal escalation and generally survive a hectic new existence, which this guide should hopefully lay out in a helpful step by step manner.

1. Never let your sibling feel alone

Witches are often warped by societal isolation and exclusion, the archetype preys on this, fuelling the fears of others while fostering the flames of resentment within the young witch. Unfortunately one of the first people affected by the onset of the archetype are the parents, who in many cases die, are made forever oblivious to the plight of their child beyond reason or are otherwise forced to be absent, as a sibling however you have much more leeway in this situation. Make sure to remind them that they are loved, that even with their new power they are human and do not deserve to be alone, remind them that they are not alone and already the archetype has lost vital ground which it would have otherwise rooted so thoroughly it would be nigh impossible to remove.

2.  Support their exploration of magical abilities, but make sure they don't go too far

Witches have a natural impulse to explore their new powers, and this can lead to wonderful new discoveries that can benefit many as well as preventing the archetype from rooting in the anxieties and turmoil born from repression. Still overindulging in magic can also lead to the archetype taking root in the form of an unstoppable madness or mania, ethics and any other previous boundaries thrown aside in the pursuit of arcane knowledge. It is important to let your sibling understand the full depth and potential of their powers but you must be vigilant for signs they are going too far. Are they asking for live test subjects? Have they suddenly become closed off about the nature of their projects? Have they been sneaking away to places where they are not easily supervised? If any of these behaviours or other similar sudden changes are observed be sure to communicate with them on the risk of overindulging in magic and what other, safer and saner means of indulging their curiosity may exist. 

3. Tell them of any changes you are experiencing

Inevitably the archetype will attempt to take root in those close to the original magic user, which often first manifests in close siblings. If you gain sudden knowledge of swordplay, a desire to go adventuring and a change in your regular emotional state be open about these changes with your sibling and others you care about, and if they believe you are changing in a way you are not noticing ensure you do not brush it off or ignore the warning and instead set aside time to have an open discussion on the subject immediately. With any luck you would be able to escape an archetype that would force you into conflict with witches and prevent the archetype of your sibling from flaring up in turn.

4. Do not be afraid to seek aid

Often times the changes brought forth by magic or related archetype are beyond your ability to counteract on your own, this is fine, you are only human after all. Many services exist to help with severe instances of ACPD such as the Royal Healer Guild, Covens against Corruption and your local branch of the Posthuman Support Services which provide many treatments, support, guidance and in extremely severe cases medicinal treatments for ACPD. This is not a full substitute for a healthy home environment and local support network but provides vital aid where you inevitably will be unable to fully provide it on your own. Remember, you are not alone no matter what the story says you should be.

5. Remember who your sibling really is

It can be easy to forget that the nascent witch is the same person they once were, but no matter what the archetype does to them it cannot change the fundamentals of their being, it can at most warp and distort. It must be emphasised that your sibling is still

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

RESPONSE:

The beginning of your storyhooks the reader and makes them want to read more. However, the story then delves into a lot of exposition about APCD, which interrupts the flow of the story. Try to be more concise in your explanation of the disorder and its effects, and get to the action of the story more quickly.

Your description of the steps to take in order to help a sibling with APCD are clear and helpful. However, the story then abruptly ends. Make sure to conclude your story more fully, tying up any loose ends and providing a satisfying resolution for the reader.
