PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"I don't understand. You say there are no laws preventing you from sharing technology or scientific data."

"Correct."

"But you still won't do so."

"Also correct. We do not wish to be responsible for the annihilation of a whole race!"

"Do you believe us to be that careless? That we would destroy ourselves so easily?"

"Not careless, but of course it would destroy you. Well, most of you. Your offspring go through a...pre- verbal stage, yes? They might survive."

There was a long pause as the human ambassador tried to digest this information and form a coherent response. "How would they survive? Anything that would cause my death would surely also kill a child."

Another long pause, this time from the Tyrrpol ambassador. "I apologize, we did not realize your offspring became &lt;&lt;frrek&gt;&gt; so young."

"What? Something didn't translate. Become what?"

"&lt;&lt;Frrek&gt;&gt;, um....solid? Set? Our offspring can accept new information without risk of death for around 2 of your years. We thought the timetable would be similar for you."

"Risk of...ambassador humans can accept new information at any point in their lifespan. Some might refuse, but there is no risk of injury or death."

"No. No no no no NO NO NO NO NO."

The Tyrrpol ambassador was still screaming when his neural net lost coherence.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

One possible issue with this story is that it feels very exposition-heavy and info-dumpy. Try to find ways to organically introduce the information in the story, rather than having the characters just spit out long paragraphs of exposition at each other.

Another issue is that the dialogue feels stiff and unnatural. See if you can find ways to make the conversations flow more smoothly and sound more natural.

One final issue is that the ending feels very abrupt and anti-climactic. See if you can find a way to make the ending more satisfying for the reader.

That being said, there are also some good things about this story. The concept is interesting and raises some questions about ethics and morality. The story also has a good sense of suspense and tension. Overall, there is potential here, but it needs some work.
