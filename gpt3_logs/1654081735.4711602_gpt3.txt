STORY:
================================

# THEY ARE REAL 

She's in me. Every single one of her layers, splattered over my fingers.

“*NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!*”  I scream.

I sob and whimp. She's gone. She's forever gone. 

They have been taking over, replacing people, perfectly mimicking their appearences, their smell, the shine of humanity in their eyes. None of it was real; a facade, a mask, all to mock and play with the feelings of men.

Some think this is the beginning of the end. Some think they're our new saviors and try to become like of them by dipping on giant tubs of frosting. Owning a bakery has become illegal, as unsuspecting store owners could be housing them without knowing. Birthday girls and boys wept when special forces invaded their parties to neutralize a threat by showering Queen Elsa's homemade frosting face with rubber bullets.

The Great British Bake Off was cancelled. 

That's where I reached my limit. I barricaded our house, prohibited the entrance of even a fly inside without it first going through the check.

Yet they finally reached me.

I will become one of them.

“Chocolate.” I say as I lick my lips smeared with cake wife.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opening of your story is very intriguing and immediately pulls the reader in. You have created a very suspenseful and unique premise. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, you might want to consider using more concrete images and descriptions. For example, in the second paragraph, you could describe the appearance of the imposters in more detail.

Second, you could also work on developing the characters more. In particular, the protagonist's emotions and motivations could be explored in more depth.

Overall, you have created a very original and suspenseful story. With some additional development, it could be even more powerful.
