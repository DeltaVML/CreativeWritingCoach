PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The long con...  

Al Yankovic was smarter than all of us.  Heck, we thought his genius was 'limited' to song parodies.  He proved us all so wrong.  Turns out, his song parody skills were complete rubbish to his real skills.  He was the most skilled programmer probably ever.  He had played us all.

While he was developing parody songs, he was also learning the algorithms of how the human brain processed language on multiple levels.  He worked these out when he was a boy listening to Dr. Demento.  He wrote out flow charts in notebooks.  His archives now have pages and pages of them digitized for us to pour through.   Once he got his first computer, his self discovery rocketed.  

On his deathbed, Weird Al set off a broadcast where he told the world what he had been working on, and where it would go.  He was going to save humanity.  He would do it with...

Weird Al, would transform into Weird A.I.

His Avatar would continue to make parody songs for generations, but he was also working out how to repair our planet.  But, if we weren't laughing while we did it, what was the point?

(sure it's short... I lost focus.  However, I wish this so badly to be true, because Weird Al is absolutely one of the best of humanity.)

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

RESPONSE:

Your story is very interesting and well-written. I particularly like the way you use humor to explore a serious topic.

There are a few things you could do to improve your story, however. First, I would recommend being more concise in your writing. This will help to keep your reader's attention focused on the story. Second, I would suggest using more active voice in your writing. This will make your story more engaging for the reader.
