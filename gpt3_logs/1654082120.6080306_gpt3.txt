STORY:
================================

Sweat dripped down my nose, mingling with the blood that poured from my mouth. This wasn't going as well as it could. At least my headphones were still in one piece. 

The man that stood before me cackled. I had never quite understood what it meant for one to 'cackle'. I figured it had just mean to laugh in an evil matter, but it was so much more in the flesh. It hurt to hear, almost as hard as the fists and feet that had pummeled me. 

"Is this all you can do, WalkMan?" He jeered. "Is this the man that defends his city? Pathetic." He shot a glare at the nearest news crew, making sure to look directly at the camera. "This is what you get for trusting a 'hero'. This is what anyone that defies me will get. Bow before me, or perish beneath me!"

He turned back to me, raising both of his fists above his head, preparing to strike with all of his power. I knew what I had to do. 

"Hey Siri" I said, coughing and spitting out another tooth. The bluetooth headphones chirped in response, acknowledging that it had heard my prompt.

"Play Forbidden Loop Omega"

The chirp sounded again in acknowledgement. I stood on my one good leg, bracing a hand on the wall to support the broken leg. The man cackled again. 

"So you choose to die on your feet. How noble."

As he brought his glowing fists down towards my head, the music swelled in my ears. I brought up one hand and caught the blow with ease. With one quick motion, I broke both of his wrists. 

He boggled at me. "No, NO, NONONONO!" He wailed. "How?"

I met his terrified gaze with a blank expression. I couldn't show any emotion. Not with this terrible noise assaulting my ears.

With another twist, I ripped his arms from their sockets. I heard the gasps from the camera crews as they captured every gruesome detail in stunning 4K definition, if their commercials could be believed. 

"Dr Doomsday, you are hereby under arrest." I spoke in an even tone, straining to keep my emotions under control. "Officers, take him away." I turned and strode away, before a reporter or police officer could ask me any potentially compromising questions. 

As I strode to the parking garage where my personal car was parked, I fumbled with my phone, desperate to stop the song that was consuming me. Bringing me to a dark place. 

"We can do it, if we try" I mumbled along, as my fingers typed my password. The Cocomelon song was almost a greater pain in my ears than sung through my broken jaw and missing teeth.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

Your story has potential, but there are some areas that could use improvement. For one, your sentences are often choppy and could be combined to create smoother, more flowing prose. Additionally, your dialogue could be more natural and less on-the-nose. In other words, your characters should sound like real people talking, rather than robots reciting lines.

One area where you did well was in your descriptions. Your readers can easily visualize the scene and the actions taking place. This is an important skill for a writer to have, so keep up the good work!
