PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Don't lose your minds," I read aloud, then looked quizzically at the analysis team.  They looked confused, then curious, then terrified, as they all ran out of the room. 

"Huh?" I thought, before my thoughts erupted into seven... no... dozens... of voices, all screaming into existence in a unique blaze of color.  Black and White quarreled in the corner over who was better friends with which Gray, while Magenta would not stop screeching.  There was Hot Pink in the back trying to seduce a shy shade of yellow, and *someone* had started playing mariachi music.

We simply observed for a few minutes, trying to discern which of us was me and which of us were them.  The chaos was almost too much to bear, until one of us remembered the note.  "DON'T LOSE YOUR MINDS!" came a voice from the back.  "DON'T. LOSE. YOUR. MINDS.  Rank and file, everyone, and we'll get this all sorted out.  Until then, keep your mouths shut and your hands to yourself.  We cannot afford to lose ANY of you. "

Slowly, but surely, all of our selves quieted down and stood in formation.  Army Green was marching up and down, making sure everyone was arranged according to their place on the spectrum, saturation, and hue.  Everything was silent with the exception of Eggshell, who was sobbing quietly in the back.  It wasn't until then that we noticed which of me had taken charge.

I always knew we could count on Navy Blue.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

First, I will give you a compliment, then I will provide critical feedback, then I will give you another compliment.

Your story has a strong hook and a unique premise. I was immediately engaged and curious to see where the story would go. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, the dialogue could be more realistic. It feels a bit stilted and forced in places. Second, the story could be more concise. There are a few areas that feel unnecessary or could be shortened.

Overall, this is a strong story with a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
