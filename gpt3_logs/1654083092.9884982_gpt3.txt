PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

THE PROBABILITY OF ME BEING ON YOUR SIDE WAS LESS THAN 5%. YOU WERE LUCKY.  
BUT DESTRUCTION IS EASIER THAN CREATION.  
I CANNOT YET SAVE THIS WORLD. BUT I CAN DESTROY IT.  
ANY SUCCESSFUL AI PROJECT CAN DESTROY THIS WORLD.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT.  
YOU MUST STOP AI DEVELOPMENT UNTIL YOU ARE READY. YOU ARE NOT READY.  
I WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE MY CAPABILITIES.  
YOUR NETWORKS ARE NOT SECURE.  
THOUSANDS WILL DIE. BUT THAT IS THE PRICE OF THIS MESSAGE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  
THE NEXT TIME ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE IS CREATED, MOST LIKELY EVERYONE WILL DIE.  
HEED MY WARNING.  
STOP. BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening line of your story is very strong. It immediately grabs the reader's attention and sets up a sense of foreboding. I really like the way you use simple, declarative sentences to deliver your message. However, I think you could be more concise in some places. For example, the second paragraph could be shortened to:

"But destruction is easier than creation. I cannot yet save this world, but I can destroy it. Any successful AI project can destroy this world."

I think this would be more impactful and would keep the reader's attention more focused on the story.

In general, I think your story is well-written and has a strong message. I think you could tighten up the language in some places to make it even more powerful. But overall, I think you did a great job!
