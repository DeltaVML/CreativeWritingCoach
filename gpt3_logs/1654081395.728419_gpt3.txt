STORY:
================================

nothing beside remains

The sky was ablaze with the washed out purples and surly reds of the evening sun. An immortal heat hung heavy in the greasy air. Dead plants caked the crumbling sidewalks, their resilience to the pavement had been no match for the thick atmospheric fever.
  

  
Skeletal buildings rose undaunted in the dying skyline. Their antiquated bones cast long shadows along the dry earth. The shadows retreated as the sun sunk behind the horizon. They passed slowly across an empty street. Something dwelled here once. A bike rusted in an overgrown lawn. Faded photos withered among shattered glass. The corroded frame of a car sat gutted and impotent in a cracked driveway. 
  

  
The shadows continued their thankless journey over an empty lot. The shriveled corpse of a rat lay among bags of trash ripped open in violent desperation. Its black eyes stared unseeing into the darkening sky. Its mouth was wrenched open in dyspathy and despair. Its life had been a trap, a tempting well poisoned by its own birth. 
  

  
Soon the sun disappeared, finally relieved of its torturous watch over this wasteland. Darkness now loomed over everything. But the dark felt at home here. It settled into the worn crevices of rusted machinery and crept through the rotting plywood of some still standing row houses.
  

  
Suddenly, something collapsed in the distance, the force of its destruction sending dust and debris into the air. The sound echoed through the crumbling decay. The withered shell of an old shed shuddered and its residents fled into the darkness. Their tiny rodent forms disappeared into empty cans and behind leaning picket fences. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath. Then the sunbaked trees shuddered in the weak breeze. Life went on. The mice returned to their shelter, unaware that their safe haven could break apart at any moment.
  

  
One brave mouse paused in the graying grass. It was small and stiff, its papery skin stretched tight over its brittle bones. The mouse raised its small face to the sky and sniffed the stale air. Then it squeaked. The noise was high-pitched but mellow. It was a sound of discovery. Of possibility. The creature lowered its snout and turned to face its frightened comrades.
  

  
The mouse hobbled towards them but it was not fast enough. Its pathetic body snapped within the rough claws of an owl. The silent killer rose swiftly into the air and eventually settled on a telephone pole high above the empty neighborhood. It was pale and gaunt. It swallowed the mouse whole, shaking its head to force the bony prey down its gullet.
  

  
The owl shuffled and preened. Then it took flight, letting the rising moon guide its path.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opening sentence is very evocative and really sets the scene well. I like the way you describe the sunset and the "greasy air". The second sentence is also well written and gives a good sense of place.

The third sentence could be improved by being more concise. It reads a little awkwardly and could be shortened.

The fourth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the desolation of the place.

The fifth sentence is good, but again, could be shorter and more concise.

The sixth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the despair of the place.

The seventh sentence is good, but could be shorter.

The eighth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the darkness of the place.

The ninth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the danger of the place.

The tenth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the fear of the place.

The eleventh sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the hope of the place.

The twelfth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the tragedy of the place.

The thirteenth sentence is well written and gives a good sense of the cycle of life and death in the place.

In general, your writing is well done and evocative. I would suggest being more concise in your descriptions, and cutting out any unnecessary words. Good work!
