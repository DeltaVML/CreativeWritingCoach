PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I walk outside 6 minutes before the time of my birth 

Watch the world as I and everyone else saw it 

Wondering what it could've meant 

They told me but four words and I didn't understand until time was up

*5 minutes*

I wait to see the sun rise 

It take only but a moment for everything to change 

I wonder what the world would become after I change 

They tell stories of a kid bursting into flames and wreaking havoc only to be snuffed out...

 On that day it rained. 

*4 minutes* 

Another kid had became water 

Nothing special just water.... 

Unfortunately she was in the shower and became one with the sea. 

I was told her parents would visit every year during her birthday wondering if she could feel their hands as they brush it along the water. 

*3 minutes* 

The system was flawed, the parents were never allowed to overhear what powers the kids got without permission. 

It was always an experiment for those bastards. 
Waiting and watching if those kids were going to tell the truth 

But it wasn't all too bad most of them, they knew the seriousness of the situation and were prepared for something like this

And they said what their power was. 

*2 minutes* 

But what I got... What I got made no sense
Everyone I knew had this elaborate way and text to know they were going to get, but I nor the people who tested me knew 

The system was perfect the epitome of perfection
Or at least until I read what was on that paper 

*1 minute* 

"don't look at me" 

I didn't get it, what did it mean? 
I look at the time as the seconds past by 
My anxiety was dripping from my soul 

I rush inside to the bathroom after a moment I look up as my body and face change, I always had a feeling it had to do with my appearance, but what I saw should never reach the other side of that door 
As I broke the glass to the mirror 

My parents rush to the noise I lock the door to the bathroom, but my father one of the few lucky he worked at the zoo he was given the strength of any animal he touched and unfortunately he broke through the door as I look into their eyes for a moment 

I scream...

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

First, I'd like to commend you on your use of descriptive language and your ability to set a scene. Your opening paragraph is particularly evocative. However, there are a few areas where your prose could be improved. For example, in the second paragraph, you might want to consider using stronger verbs to describe the protagonist's actions. Additionally, in the third paragraph, you might want to clarify what the protagonist is wondering about.

In general, I think your story has potential, but it might benefit from a bit more development in terms of plot and character. For instance, it might be helpful to give the reader more information about the protagonist's background and why they are testing their powers. Additionally, the story might be more suspenseful if the reader knew more about the consequences of the protagonist's actions.
