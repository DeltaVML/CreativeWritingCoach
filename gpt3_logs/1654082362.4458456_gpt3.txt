STORY:
================================

AITA for trying to help a woman get out of an abusive relationship?

So basically I have this work rival and he shows all the signs of being an abuser. He punches holes in walls, he is very full of himself, he seems so unfeeling I'd say like a brick wall, but honestly more like titanium. And he has this crazy death stare he can give sometimes.

Anyway, due to work out personal lives are unfortunately also intertwined. After doing some thinking I decided to pick up his girlfriend for some tea and try to really change her mind about her relationship with him.

Then waddaya know, this dude literally busts my door down (after assaulting my groundskeepers!) And rushes her away before she would even have a chance to protest. Classic abusive relationship stuff.

Yet for some reason most of the people we know always take his side on things

AITA?

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

RESPONSE:

================================

First of all, congratulations on tackling a difficult and heavy subject matter. It is not easy to write about abuse, but you have done so with sensitivity and thoughtfulness.

There are a few areas I would suggest you work on, in order to take your story to the next level. First, I would recommend using more concrete and specific language. For example, rather than saying your rival is "very full of himself," you could describe how he carries himself in specific ways that convey his arrogance.

Second, I would recommend using dialogue more effectively to move the story forward and reveal character. Right now, much of the story is told through exposition, which can be a bit dry and difficult for readers to engage with.

Finally, I would recommend ending the story on a more powerful note. Perhaps the protagonist could have a conversation with the girlfriend after the incident, in which she reveals her true feelings about the relationship.

These are just a few suggestions - overall, you have written a moving and thought-provoking story. Keep up the good work!
