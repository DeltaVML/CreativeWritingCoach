PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

She was on the door of death. Pale palid skin withering away as finality crept ever closer and closer. She coughs, wet and phlegmy, a glob of bloodied snot spitting out and disintigrating into the sheets. 

"What... what time is it?" her voice croaks. 

A damp wet towel is pressed to her forehead. "Morning," the reply is tired, so wrung out of emotions that all it can do is whisper. "How are you doing my dear? How do you feel?"

She opens her mouth to respond, but something else shoves its way out. Vomit: yellow, acidic and warm. It spills out onto the bed, just enough to drench the sheets, but little enough due to her previous regurgitations. 

"Here," a frigid glass is pressed to her lips. It hurts to touch, biting at skin and bone, and the water is even more so. The deluge almost makes her vomit it right back up, but a hissed breath and whispered curse keep it down. 

"I..." she whispers.

"You'll be fine," even in the situation, even in spite of the doubt in his voice, he brings all his scared courage to the forefront, "You'll be fine," he repeats, "You're getting better. Heaven be damned I will spend an eternity by your side if that is what it takes for you to get better. I won't let you go."

She meets his wavering confidence with her own, "Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere."

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

Your story is well-written and engaging. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, your description of the protagonist's illness is very graphic and may be too much for some readers. You may want to tone it down a bit.

Second, the dialogue between the protagonist and the other character could be more natural. It sounds a bit stilted and forced in places.

Overall, this is a well-written story with a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
