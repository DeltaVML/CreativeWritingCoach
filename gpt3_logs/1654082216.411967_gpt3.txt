PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

We had failed.

The whole country, maybe the entire world had been counting on us to stop Professor Parasaurolophus from releasing his bio-weapon and we failed.  I tore my eyes away from the exhaust trail that was already hundreds of metres long and quickly stretching into kilometres to glare at the scaled figure held in Dauntless's unrelenting grasp.  "Where is the self-destruct!?"  The Saurian only laughed at the rock-skinned hero, his crazed eyes peering through broken glasses.

"Why on Terra would I build a self-destruct in my life's work?"

The rocket was travelling further    "Jet Setter!  Goggles!"  Startled, the heroine jumped at my demand even as her hands reflexively moved to the item in question.  "I- I can't, I'd never catch it."  Her voice, normally a bright and upbeat tone to match her heroic persona was low and soft in a way she normally never allows herself to use when in costume.  I knew she couldn't, her top speed had never even reached Mach 1 but there was no time to explain, I marched the three steps to her side and snatched them right off her head, honey-blonde hair exploding outwards as it was freed from the straps.

Gods I love it when she lets her hair down.

She wasn't much smaller than me thankfully, the protective eyewear only needed a quick pull to tighten.  I ordered Rock Lock to break the window as my fingers moved to my left wrist, dancing over the touchscreen that held my 'soundtrack to victory'.  I moved past my usual forte - rock, metal, techno, even a few pop songs when appropriate - and hit the big, black button.  A voice came from my earpieces, asking for confirmation.

"Confirm, situation Omega Black.  Passphrase, 'never gonna give you up'."

My teammates gasped, except for Jet, who frowned and raised a hand like she wanted to slap me.  I didn't blame them, the worst they'd ever seen me pull out was Omega that time the earthquake brought down the shopping centre.  And the last time before that was... with my old team.

"Track seven."

Thrumming strings of an electric guitar roared in my eardrums, I felt my body begin warming up in response.  I had other songs that would allow me flight, speed, even limited invincibility, but none of them had the right balance for this scenario.

*"You're making a choice to live like this."*

"Mix-Master-"  I didn't stay to listen, we didn't have time.  The world didn't have time.  I crouched down, feeling the heat pool in my body I pushed it towards my feet and released it.  I exploded out the newest hole in the ParaSphere, propelled by my own flames like the rocket I was chasing.

*"In all of the noise I am silent."*

 The wind tore at my costume as I flew, crossing hundreds of metres in seconds, I focused on the sensation of burning and pushed the flames further.  The goggles pressed into my skin, compacting it against the bones in my face as I moved faster, the rocket was still moving farther away.

*"We already know how it ends tonight."*

The fire burned hotter, from red to white.  A cone of air began to form in front of me as I pushed even further, igniting reserves even I didn't know I had.  A cone of air began to form around me.

*"You run in the dark through a firefight."*

Sound shattered, and I began to catch up.  Hundreds of kilometres behind and closing, I pictured who I was fighting for.  Kilometres behind and closing, I remembered who I had lost.  Hundreds of metres, the fire was too much, I could feel my body cooking from the inside out.  I drew level, my arms wrapped around the body of the missile and I heaved.

By the scantest of degrees our trajectory changed, up, up... UP!  I closed my eyes and let the heat out.

*"Let me light up the sky."*

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opening of this story is very strong, and really pulls the reader in. The use of short, declarative sentences is effective in conveying the urgency of the situation. I also like the way the protagonist is immediately established as the leader of the team.

However, there are a few issues with the second half of the story. Firstly, the dialogue feels stilted and unnatural. It sounds like the characters are reciting lines, rather than having a conversation. Secondly, the protagonist's inner monologue feels out of place and distracting. It breaks up the action and slows down the pacing of the story.

Overall, this is a strong story with a lot of potential. With a few tweaks, it could be even better.
