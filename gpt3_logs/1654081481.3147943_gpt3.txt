STORY:
================================

Several times, travelers made complaints about the suspicious Eridanian from System HD265-T3 skulking around the exit of Gate E3.  Arrival flights from Earth disembarked their passengers here, each of them in a rush to meet connecting flights. The Eridanian, known professionally as ‘K’, knew he was untouchable. Countless bribes over the past cycle had ensured that he and his partner, ‘G’, could work free from the interference of flight security.

Nearby drones announced the arrival of Flight 2938 at Gate E3. K imagined that he was an ancient Terran predator as he observed the herd of masked humans pour out of the gate. He scanned each of them individually, the processing power of his advanced mind allowing for minute details to be observed within nanoseconds. He felt a pronounced sense of superiority as he watched them scramble, some obviously new to wearing the bulky, uncomfortable masks. His observations were immediately transponded to G. 

*An old woman. Slow. Easy. Family too large.*

*Child. Too noisy.* 

*Paired mates. One making their way to restroom. Too risky, partner may return early.* 

*Another old one. Assisted transportation through spaceport. Too much oversight.*


	As the rush of passengers in the terminal died down, K worried that this flight would be another dud. Just as he felt ready to give up, one last straggler made their way out of the gate. K immediately went to transponding. 


	*Last passenger. Indeterminate gender. One bad leg. Alone. Terminal mostly empty.  Seems unfamiliar with spaceport layout. This is the one.*


	Across the room, G approached the target, taking the form of an old Terran spaceport attendant. The hum of kind words and friendly gestures echoed across the vacant terminal. K appreciated G’s approach to abducting the targets. Fear had a way of ruining the goods if applied too early. No, they needed to be comfortable if their product’s purity was to be maintained. Purer product would lead to better highs in their customers.


	Now, the target followed G towards K’s location. He wondered what the lie was this time. Usually, they were told that they’d be assisted through the spaceport, they only needed to check in over there, in the side room used for new passenger processing. In reality, the room had been rented with the same bribes that kept flight security away. K opened the door as they approached. G, keeping to his polite disguise, gave an ‘after you’ to the passenger, who entered first. The professionals followed, sealing the door behind them.


	Fear was appropriate now. The process went formulaically: the target realized that the empty room was a trap, and begin to panic, beginning the production of fluids. G resumed his natural form, with all its tentacles, and held the prey down, allowing K to inject the target with a drug that would induce an elevated stress response, ensuring enough fluids were produced. K left the terrified, squirming target’s mask on. It would catch the tears for him, making collection easier. 


	The Eridanian waited in the corner of the room, letting the injection work as G continued holding down the target. He prepped the vial for collection, and strode back over to the target, who was now still. K pulled the mask off, holding the vial low, ready to the most difficult portion of the human’s fluid. Instead of tears, the unmasking exposed some thing’s poor attempt to fully mimic the human form. “What the –"

Before he could finish, the face seemed to melt and crawl away in different directions on the floor. Each separate chunk that escaped grew, taking the form of fully armed police.  At least seven now stood in the room.  


“GALPOL, Human Trafficking/Narcotics Division, LEGION Unit. Get on the ground! Get on the fucking ground!” K fell flat, arms behind his head. G was screaming in pain—one of his tentacles writhing on the ground next to his partner. In between screams, he heard a transponder click on.


	*Two perps held. Prep the body bags. Get a cleaner, too.*
