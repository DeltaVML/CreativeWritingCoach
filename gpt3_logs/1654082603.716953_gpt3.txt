PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

We fell, yes. But what did we fall for? Asking why? The very thing our Creator encouraged?

&amp;#x200B;

We are punished in a world Humanity created out of their own guilt, surrounded by disgusting creatures, away from the light of the Creator, condemned to a Hell not of our making, but because Humans thought they deserved to be punished. A horrible place built around guilt with monsters all created from latent fears in the minds of Humanity and what are we but the occasional light in the darkness? Our Leader, the oft-proclaimed "King Of Hell" was the Creator's chosen son until humanity came along, and his only crime was to ask why. Why bow to these murderous, imperfect creatures? Why serve them instead of you, my Mother and my Father?

&amp;#x200B;

For these questions, I am left to weep. When a damned soul wanders near, they feel the pain of my sorrow and their personal Hell is made worse. Mine is everlasting and worse than they could ever know.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The "compliment sandwich" method of feedback involves starting with a compliment, followed by constructive criticism, and ending with another compliment. This method allows the writer to feel good about their work while still being able to improve.

The beginning of your story is very evocative and immediately pulls the reader in. You ask a question that makes the reader think about their own beliefs and what they would do in your situation. This is very effective in getting the reader engaged.

However, the middle of your story drags a bit and feels somewhat preachy. You also switch from first person to third person point of view, which can be confusing for the reader. It might be helpful to focus on one character's story and stay in first person point of view throughout the story.

The ending of your story is very powerful and leaves the reader with a lot to think about. You effectively use imagery and emotion to create a sense of despair and hopelessness.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. You have a great eye for detail and you are able to create characters that the reader can empathize with. With a few tweaks, your stories will be even more engaging and enjoyable for the reader.
