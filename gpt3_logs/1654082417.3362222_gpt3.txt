STORY:
================================

AITA for destroying a universe?

Now, before you start judging, let me explain.

So I was doing my thing, being the god of darkness and destruction and all that, when I came across a universe that was filled with mortal life forms. Now, I despise mortal life forms, and this universe’s dominant ones in particular were… not very smart, to say the least. They were not good at keeping their energy-creating processes eco-friendly, wiping out the populations of inhabited planets within a decade of landing on them. By the time I noticed them, they’d eliminated all life forms on all the planets of at least half of their universe’s galaxies. I’d usually enjoy watching that kinda stuff happen, but even I found it stupid how they did absolutely nothing to stop it; heck, it didn’t seem like they cared or even noticed it at all. So I figured I’d… give them a hand, as the best way to put it would be. I moseyed on over to their universe, kinda just made a Big Crunch happen, and… bloop. Universe destroyed.

Of course, the goddess of light and creation got super mad at me, saying how “you should’ve given them a chance”, “allowed me to handle them”, “I’d kick you off the Divine Council if I could”, blah blah blah. I know the next Divine Council meeting, which is coming up in just a few weeks, won’t go down so well, so I figured I’d get some advice from you mortals on what to do.

AITA?

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

RESPONSE:

================================

The start of this story is very strong, it immediately draws the reader in with its opening line. The use of second person point of view is also effective in making the reader feel as though they are a part of the story. However, there are a few areas where the prose could be improved. For example, the sentence " Now, before you start judging, let me explain." could be rewritten as "Before you start judging me, let me explain." This would make the sentence sound more natural.

In general, the story is well written and engaging. The use of humor is also effective in keeping the reader interested. However, there are a few areas where the prose could be improved. For example, the sentence "So I was doing my thing, being the god of darkness and destruction and all that, when I came across a universe that was filled with mortal life forms." could be rewritten as "I was doing my thing as the god of darkness and destruction when I came across a universe filled with mortal life forms." This would make the sentence sound more concise and flowing.

Overall, this is a well-written and humorous story. However, there are a few areas of the prose that could be improved. With a few minor tweaks, this story could be even stronger.
