PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

The universe has never been without its sense of irony.  How else could one rationalize its greatest truth, that the most loved creatures ever to exist within it were also the source of the most hatred?  It was this nagging thought that had driven the Fallen past despair and to the brink of insanity.  Eons ago, the Fallen had rebelled against the Father, and while they had thought the Father merciful in merely banishing them for their treachery, over time it became clear that it was anything but.

The first humans to arrive in Hell were naturally terrified.  They feared the infinite retribution of the Father for their sins, but after discovering the true nature of their predicament, they began to relax.  The Fallen, under Lucifer's leadership, had agreed to use their time and knowledge to try to reform the lost souls that were banished along with them.  They created their own morality, similar to what the Father had originally intended, but without the worship and submission to the Father.  Their vision was one of a paradise where everyone lived in harmony not out of fear, but out of free will.

At first, they were successful in their endeavors.  People were naturally receptive to an offer of redemption rather than the unspeakable horrors they had been warned of.  They worked hard on building up their utopian society and for the most part, it was successful.  There were a few who rejected salvation though, and the Fallen were unsure of what to do with them.  

As time passed, more and more souls populated Hell, with their sins becoming more numerous and grotesque in nature.  The irredeemables, as they became known, grew in numbers exponentially.  Lucifer could not comprehend why these creatures, the humans whom the Father gave his infinite love to so freely, would still willingly choose an existence of misery and hate.  It became increasingly difficult to contain the pure evil of the irredeemables flooding Hell, and soon Hell itself was at war.   The Fallen held strong for a long while, but as human populations continued to grow and the never ending stream of souls into Hell continued to pour in, it became obvious that the battle was unwinnable.  

Left broken and defeated, the Fallen retreated, unable to defend their disciples from the acts of pure depravity of the malicious souls.  Once called irredeemables, they seized control over every inch of Hell and became the new ruling class known as demons.  The demons delighted in tormenting other humans, giving into their deepest, darkest desires.  Once a shining beacon of hope, Hell became a symbol of the greatest evil the universe had to offer.

But for all their various tortures, perhaps the most ingenious agony inflicted by the demons was to leave the Fallen alone.  The Fallen were intentionally left to do nothing but watch helplessly as their dream turned to ash, and they were powerless to stop it.  All they could do was to hide themselves away and weep endlessly, for evil had conquered every corner of Hell, and their paradise was lost.
