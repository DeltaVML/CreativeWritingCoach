#Genreic Shift

Part 4

Genrene had just managed to climb a tree before a figure stumbled out of the shadows. Cyrus hobbled towards the statue and promptly fell to his knees before it. He was covered in blood, more than Genrene knew that could come from only two men. No, another cluster of his once-loyal men had chased him too. Where were they now? Likely dead at his first mate’s hands.

Genrene’s thoughts quickly went blank though and his eyes widened as the spectacle of the statue before him turned. Turned? No, as it corrupted. Sure, it became a rusted brown first, as if it were a giant slab of iron left out in the rain for centuries, but as he watched, the land around him turned too.

“My servant,” the entity rumbled. “Rise Cyrus, for there is work to be done. This isle you stand upon is one a part of the forgotten lands. Of antiquated civilisations made from metals long lost to decay. Now, my child of doom, you shall be used as a vessel to spread dyspathy and shadow beyond your realm.”

Genrene was confused for a moment. Why would a creature such as this explain its plan to its own mindless servant? Why bother with the monologue? Genrene’s answer came quickly and shocked him to his core.

There, on closer inspection, he saw Cyrus struggle and writhe on the ground. All around him, the rust grew and consumed all. But not just simple rust born of water, no. Something dwelled there and darkness loomed over everything.

“Do you accept your place, my servant?” the statue boomed.

“Yeeeesss,” Cyrus hissed through gritted teeth.

“Good. The god of gods created us to end the world many centuries ago, and still, humanity has held out. We were made in the likeness of a scourge to wipe out all of Pandora’s children. And so we will.”

Cyrus continued to writhe on the ground but Genrene remained still, not daring to give in to the hope that his most trusted friend still remained.

“I have one last task for you, my servant. End your captain in the trees. And do not let him stop the ship. Despite what he might try, I fear it is too late for him, but I must remain certain.”

And with that, the darkness left.

Rust still remained instilled deep into the ground. Perhaps Genrene was so caught up by the haunting spirit or that it knew of his presence, but he hadn’t noticed when the land around him changed.

The island wasn't of dark forests and stone-peaked mountains anymore. When Genrene looked up from Cyrus’ now prone form, he was left breathless at the visage of a ruined civilisation. Buildings rose high around him, coloured with the same rust as he’d seen before. The green forest underbrush now gave way to cracked and uncared for roads. Rust flaked everything and everywhere.

‘But how was this?’ Genrene thought. ‘Buildings made of metal rather than wood? Giant structures taller than should be possible?’

"A Serious house on serious earth," he whispered. An old saying that meant nonsense.

Genrene didn’t look back from the mesmerising structures around him until he felt the trunk of his lone tree sway. Before he was given an opportunity to look down though, he stumbled and half slid half fell to the ground. He knew who had done it before he even saw him.

Cyrus stood over him, teeth bared and rusted needle-like blade pointed threateningly toward him. Genrene unsheathed his own cutlass and the dance of steel began.

Silver met brown and flakes of both flew in all directions. Genrene’s blade was heavier and less sharp but was also stronger. Even so, the first blow took him by surprise and he threw himself back as the point jabbed at his side.

Cyrus dove forward, allowing his blood lust to drive him into a reckless attack. Though Genrene wasn't expecting such a brutal attack, he managed to expertly dodge the blow by jumping aside and plunged his own blade into his first mate’s back. The steel quivered there for a second and his friend tried to rise from the wound but could not.

Genrene marvelled at his own luck before remembering that the man lying before him had taken on a group of men before this and had won.

Genrene thought to win his friend back with words but his mouth dried up and his throat tightened. And so, call it cowardice if you must, but he raised the cutlass once more and dealt the final blow before charging off away from the cursed abandoned town.

Merely moments later, an exhausted flustered Genrene stood on the beach. He doubled over and breathed heavily as his beloved ship, The Genre, sailed further away, now just a misty shadow.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of detailed feedback to improve your prose and style:

==========

RESPONSE:

1. You have a great opening sentence that really draws the reader in.

2. I love the description of the statue turning to rust. It's really evocative and sets the scene well.

3. The dialogue between the entity and Cyrus is great. It's chilling and really gets the reader invested in the story.

4. The final paragraph is a great way to end the story. It's open-ended and leaves the reader wanting more.
