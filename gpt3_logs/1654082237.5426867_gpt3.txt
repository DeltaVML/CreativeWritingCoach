PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I reached over and used my thumb to start my playlist, and as nymphetamine girl began, I let the mix of operatic and goth metal cause my body to begin to slowly relax, I reacted. I felt my muscles become smoother and time slowed down. I could suddenly see, almost like a premonition, everything that was going to happen as the pandora add played. The instant that it changed, to loco by coal chamber, time went from almost standing still, to life being in overdrive, and that's when my adrenal glands suddenly decided to kick in. No matter how hard my opponent hits me, it doesn't matter; I've never felt as alive as I have in the last two thousand years.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

RESPONSE:

================================

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that need improvement. First, your opening sentence is a bit choppy and could be smoother. Additionally, your use of adjectives and description could be more concise and vivid. For example, instead of saying "I felt my muscles become smoother," you could say "I felt my muscles relax."

That being said, you have a good grasp of story structure and your use of sensory detail is excellent. Overall, with a few revisions, this could be a great story.
