PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================



I  was never much for video games let alone video game music. But one the first time I stumbled upon "song of the ancients" I knew even as it was loading that something wrong would happen. So everytime I landed on it or a variant I threw it on my forbidden Playlist. Praying I would never have to use it. Sadly the day had come and the dread was overwhelming. But as it started my worst fears were confirmed as if part of me subconsciously knew that this was was how it would all end.

The unspeakable horrors come through the bizzare eldtritch portal were beyond comprehension. My rock playlist had failed me for the first time in a kong time and my classic kept giving me the same choice i didnt like or really understand... but to the forbidden Playlist as the answer. My hands shaked  as my fingers slide towards it in apprehension for what would happen when it started....

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The first paragraph of your story sets up the conflict nicely, and I like the way you describe the feeling of dread that the protagonist is experiencing. However, the second paragraph feels a bit choppy and difficult to follow. I would recommend restructuring it a bit to make the events more clear. Additionally, you may want to consider adding more description to paint a clearer picture for the reader.

In general, your story has potential but it needs more development in order to be truly successful. With a bit more work, I think you could create a really atmospheric and suspenseful piece.
