PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I stare at the piles of icing on the floor in front of me. In my hand, is a small ball of cake coloured with almost all the colours of the rainbow. 

*That cake used to be a chunk of my wife’s arm.*  

For the past few months, random objects around the world were somehow transformed into a perfect cake replica. It started small, with things like cans of soda and flashlights. Then it grew bigger, replicating things like doors, streetlights, and TVs. At some point, the Eiffel Tower was transformed into cake. Anyone around the tower when it fell during that rainy day was killed, crushed under the huge blobs of cake that fell around them. People thought that was as bad as the “Cakedemic” could get. Until today. Random people began disappearing, being replaced by cake in an instant. There is no cure, and there is no way to stop anyone from being caked. I never thought it would happen to anyone in my family though, but look at what just happened. 

I get up off the floor. I once read online that once one item is caked, it tends to spread to the surrounding environment, and other items nearby also get caked. I need to act quickly. 

I pick up a knife, and begin stabbing random things. Each time, the knife ends up with pieces of cake on the blade. The fridge, cake. The oven, cake. The TV, cake. *Everything, cake.* 

I hear knocking on the door. “Hey, there’s something up with the side of your house. I think you all got caked. You okay in there?”

I creep up to the door. “Hey, answer me. Are you oka-“ the sentence gets cut off suddenly. 

I open the door. My next door neighbour is standing there. There’s cake on his head, like it just fell on him, and there’s a shocked expression on his face. However, I know. I know that this “Cakedemic” has just replaced him with cake. It won’t fool me.

I stab him with the knife. He looks down at me, shocked. Oh no. He was not cake. I open my mouth, ready to say anything, but I freeze. Something’s happening to him. 

The blood dripping from his new stab wound isn’t flowing anymore. Then it happens. The blood, previously a liquid, suddenly turns into red icing before my eyes, and I pull the knife out in shock. I look up at his face, and his expression remains frozen. He’s just been caked. 

I clench the knife in horror, but something’s wrong. I feel my hand go through the handle, as if it was just a pillow, but it isn’t a pillow I’m holding. It’s cake. 

Everything around me begins falling apart. All of it is cake. The walls are cake. The ceiling is cake. The ceiling lights are cake. I look up just in time to see a large piece of cake fall from the ceiling, and hit me square in the head. 

I’m lying dazed on the floor, with pieces of cake falling on me. Eventually, the cake fully covers me, and I begin suffocating. There’s too much cake, and I can’t breathe. I can’t eat my way out, and I can’t move my arms. After a few minutes, I finally black out, freed from this cake hell. 

*10 minutes later*

“And we are live. I am currently standing in front of another case of the Cakedemic. Just half an hour ago, this was a normal home, with a couple living inside. Now, it’s all cake. First responders report that the two people living inside the house have died, one from caking, and the other from suffocation. A third body was found outside the house, also caked. Now, we don’t have all the details…”

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The story opens with a strong image of the piles of icing on the floor, and the ball of cake in the protagonist's hand. This immediately sets the tone for the story, and gives the reader a sense of foreboding.

However, the following sentence feels out of place and interrupts the flow of the story: *That cake used to be a chunk of my wife's arm.* This sentence is unnecessary and could be removed without affecting the story.

The story then goes on to describe the 'Cakedemic' in detail. This is well done, as it gives the reader a clear idea of the situation.

The protagonist's reaction to the 'Cakedemic' is also well done. The scene where he stabs random things in his house is particularly effective in conveying his desperation.

However, the ending of the story is somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying. The reader is left with more questions than answers, and the story ends on a note of confusion and horror.
