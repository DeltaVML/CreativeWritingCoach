STORY:
================================

“*Don’t do it, captain*.”

I stand in front of the window, narrowing my eyes at the handwritten note on the paper in front of me as I read it over twice more.

“Um, excuse me?” I say as I tap the window.

They look up to me, and I can see them withhold from rolling their eyes. They take a deep breath, then slide the glass to the side. “Yes, sir?” they almost sigh.

“Sorry, I just think there’s been a mishap, can you check this for me?” I say as I hand the paper over to them.

“Okay… sir you do realize I won’t be able to read this, right?” they say as they take the paper from my hands slowly, staring at me with bored eyes.

“Yes, just… aren’t most people’s a bit… longer?”

They flip the paper over, then scan over it. “This looks like a normal length document to me, sir.” As they finish, they begin to hand the paper back to me.

“What?” I ask in confusion as I take the paper back. “But it…” I trail off as I look down to the now completely written document before me, titled, “*Alternative Reader.*”

For a moment I’m silent, dumbfounded as I scan the paper up and down, looking for the handwritten bit I saw before. Unable to find it, I flip the page over, searching over every square centimeter of the paper for any trace of the writing.

“Sir?” The voice of the worker brings me back to reality as they tap at the glass. “Do you have any additional complaints or concerns?”

I blink a few times, looking up to them, then back down to the paper. “Uh, no. Sorry, thank you for your help.” I see them nod in response and begin to close the sliding window before I turn around and walk to the exit of the building. As I walk down the street, I hold the page out in front of me, still searching for the message I saw written on it just minutes prior. Arriving to the bus stop, I sit down, continuing to look it over without actually reading it.

It takes the sound of the automated audio messages of the bus arriving to finally pull me from my daze. Getting up from my seat, I fold the paper up briefly as I get on the bus and try to find a seat. Then, when I finally sit down, I unfold it, and begin to read it in earnest.

“*Alternative Reader.*

“*Class: S*”

I withhold a gasp as my eyes widen, and I set the paper down for a moment. In my chest, I can feel my heart thumping as I close my eyes. Taking a deep, shaky breath, I pick up the paper again, and open my eyes to read on.

“*Any persons with this power will gain the ability to see between the veils of reality and choice. The Holder will perceive a variety of sensory stimuli from parallel realities. There is no requirement for these realities to have large differences, or be based on the choices of the Holder, all that is required is that the ‘observed’ realities be similar to that of the Holder.*

“*The stimuli need not be temporally locked to the current location of the user, nor do the stimuli they would experience need to be that which they would perceive at the temporal coordinates they would therein inhabit.*”

The sounds of the bus grow louder around me as I continue reading. Digging my knuckle into my temple to try and stave off the incoming headache, I continue.

“*The only requirements and patterns for this ability are thus: Perceived events will only be of the present or future, and the strength and time in which events are perceived is based upon the severity in which that choice deviates from the natural timeline. The more impactful the choice, the more clear the stimuli will appear, and the more disjointed from its temporal location it may be.*”

The sounds still grow louder around me, along with the whispers of the others on the bus. Still, I ignore it, and read on.

“*The different strengths of the stimuli can range between the following: Seeing ‘ghosts’ or ‘echoes’ of others as they perform choices seconds apart from when they actually do. Hearing whispers, or feeling, smelling, or tasting ‘phantom’ effects. At most impactful, these could include hearing entire phrases or conversations, as well as seeing—*“

“Excuse me!” an overly loud voice startles me from my reading, and I feel a hand that isn’t there grab me on the shoulder. I nearly jump to my feet as I look up and see someone standing before me. “Sorry,” they say, and though their voice sounds soft, it hurts my ears to listen to them. “Can I have the seat next to you?”

“Y—yeah, sorry,” I say as I scoot over a bit to free up the space to my side.

“Thank you.”

I have to resist the urge to cover my ears as they sit down next to me and begin talking, so to tune them out, I look back down to my paper to read further. As I do, however, the paper is mostly blank once more, save for those same four words at the top of the page.

And slowly, in the back of my mind, the whisper of a man’s voice grows.

“Please, Captain! Why would you do this!?”

Heavily inspired by a certain choose-your-own-adventure film released recently. Saw a chance, and I just couldn't get this idea out of my head, so here it is.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The beginning of your story is very confusing and hard to follow. You need to work on making your prose more clear and concise. I would also recommend starting with a more action-packed opening to hook your reader's attention.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. I think with some more practice, you could produce some really great work.
