STORY:
================================

Praxius knew, without even the smallest nagging doubt, that he would be around 10 minutes late this morning. 

He had only slept for forty six days. He was positive that he was suffering from some kind of insomnia and was absolutely sure that this was causing him fatigue. 

Today, he was entirely convinced that he was, despite his disappointing slumber, awake. You couldn't have persuaded him otherwise, for his eyes were definitely open and he had walked from where he woke up to where he currently was and this, according to Praxius, was not up for debate.

He had spent the evening eating bags of Kroffle nuts and watching reruns of GewGew -.....-+..-. His friends believed that GewGew -.....-+..- had long since passed it's used by date but Praxius was adamant that he still enjoyed it. He was 100% sure that the only way to eat Kroffle nuts was with the ploonum on, despite almost everyone else that he knew going to great lengths or peel the ploonum off. He knew for certain that he had an opinion about this. 

He raised his arm above his head to stretch with a dull hope that it might draw some energy back into his bodies. As his middle back arched and stretched, he felt a sense of what he was sure was satisfaction. He was so caught up in the moment that he had forgotten to breath properly. This manifested itself in an abrupt cough. 

This cough sent a chunk of *something* up into that place in his left throat, you know, that annoying little place where if you cough something up, you don't want to spit it out but it's past the point where you'd prefer it to go back down. 

He believed, unwaveringly, that he was sick and tired of the goop and gunk that always came out of his lung at the worst moments. He knew without even the most minute skerrick of doubt, that he found this sensation amazingly unpleasant so he was more sure than he had ever been that when this mucus met it's future home on the cold, wet earth of Androfalou Quazar and was gone from his left throat for good, he would undoubtedly, certainly feel better

He looked around until he was sure that noone was looking and he was extremely confident that he could spit it out without anyone batting an eye. 

He cleared his throat aggressively and the culprit shot from the pits of his throat and bounced off the back of his lips. 

This was no regular piece of phlegm, oh no, no, no. 

He inspected the asophegeal imposter with his tongue. A sense of dread enveloped his entire being. 

He was absolutely, unequivocally, definitely certain of his belief that he had coughed up a run of the mill alien loogie.

He began to disintegrate, his very cells began shrinking. His skins fell off his bone and his bone crumbled into a dust so fine that the smallest gust of wind blew it into a cloud that disappeared in the blink of an eye. Everything that Plaxius once was had disappeared into the purple night of Androfolou Quazar. 

All that lay in the spot that he stood was the undigested and accidentally inhaled ploonum of a Kroffle nut.
