STORY:
================================

I told her not to go outside, not in broad daylight. But Miri had wanted to see the sun. And they'd gotten to her.

I woke that morning to find her gone, and I panicked. I ran to the foyer of the building we'd been hiding in, and I saw her standing there.

She looked normal, just like she always did. But I knew something was wrong. I ran to her. I could tell she wasn't moving, not even breathing, even though she was still standing up. I extended a trembling hand to touch her arm, dreading what I'd find.

My fingertips came away with a thin coating of flesh-colored frosting.

My wife had become *a cake.*

At first we had thought it was whimsical. It was cute. Look a can of coke -- wait, no, it's a cake! Look, a brand-new PS5! Ha, wrong! It's a *cake!* Realistic cakes were everywhere, on social media.

And then, one day, they were just everywhere, *period.*

In the beginning, it had just seemed like really fast and extremely skilled acts of baking and legerdemain. People thought they must be some sort of guerilla street artists, trying to say something profound about society by replacing everyday objects with perfect cake-based facsimiles.

Their creations were indistinguishable from the real thing until you touched them, and then they were revealed as superficial shells of frosting and fondant concealing the truth of soft spongy cake in a variety of flavors.

But then, it started happening to animals. It even started happening to people. Cut into one of these animal or person-cakes, and you'd see the whole body rendered in cake, in perfect detail, with white sponge for bone, and different shades of red velvet for muscles and organs. These were no mere bakery creations. These were living beings, our pets, our friends, and even our families, *transmuted* into cakes.

Soon after, the Cake Cultists revealed themselves, announcing their existence to the world, along with the fact that they had members placed in the highest ranks of government, industry, and the military. They appeared on every screen -- or at least those that hadn't already been turned to cake -- announcing their goal: in service to their dark master, an entity whom they called "The Cake of Infinite Tiers" they would turn the whole world and everyone in it, into *cake.*

I dropped to my knees beside my beloved Miri, now just a cake. I wanted to hold her, but I couldn't bear the thought of her cake body crumbling in my arms, or my hot tears dissolving her frosting and fondant flesh. So I just knelt beside her, and wept.

Then I heard the footsteps. I looked up, and I saw them, walking in through the glass doors that led outside.

Cake Cultists, three of them. Each wore a long dark robe, and a mask like a black, multi-tiered wedding cake. Overcome with grief and rage, I struggled to my feet, clenching my fists in hopeless fury.

"Do it! Do it, you sons of bitches! I don't care anymore! Get it over with, you bastards!" I screamed.

The Cultists looked at each other, and then the middle cultist stepped forward. He extended his hand towards me. I felt a tingling, as I began to change...

Suddenly, a black Dodge Challenger smashed in through the glass door, and rammed right into the middle cultist, who screamed as he was slammed to ground and then crushed beneath the front tires.

A figure in a hooded leather jacket leaped out of the driver's seat of the car. The two remaining Cultists faced off against him, each extending an arm towards the new arrival. Before they could work their dark transmutation upon him, he extended an open hand towards each of them, and slowly began to close his fists.

The Cultists began to writhe and scream, clawing at their Cake-masks, which were crumpling in on themselves, getting smaller and smaller. I looked away in horror before I saw how it ended. I just heard two sickening, cracking, squelching noises, and then the sound of two bodies hitting the foyer floor.

I looked fearfully up at the stranger, his face hidden in his dark hood. He approached me, and extended his hand in my direction.

"Wait, I'm not with them, I--" I began, stammering. Then I realized he wasn't pointing his hand at me. He was pointing it at Miri.

My eyes widened, as the air around the cake that had been my wife rippled with some unseen force. The fingerprints on her arm where I'd marred her frosting vanished. There was no visible change beyond that, for the cake facsimiles were always perfect visual copies, but suddenly Miri was collapsing to the floor, gasping. She was flesh and blood again.

I cried out in wonder and relief, rushing to embrace her, pulling her close to me as she slowly regained her senses. Tearfully, I looked up at the stranger.

"Thank you! Thank God for you! How....how did you do that? Who are you?" I stammered in amazement.

He pulled back his hood, revealing a the face of a middle aged man with dark hair, and olive skin.

"The Cake Cultists have defiled that which I hold most sacred." he said, an undercurrent of passion and

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

RESPONSE:

First, I want to commend you on writing a story that is both original and horrifying. The concept of the Cake Cultists is both intriguing and disturbing, and I think you did a great job of conveying the fear and confusion that would come with such a situation.

That said, there are a few areas where I think you could improve. First, I think you could be more concise in your writing. There are a few areas where you go into too much detail, or where you could tighten up your prose. For example, in the second paragraph, you could cut out some of the details about the different types of cakes, and focus more on the reaction of the characters.

Second, I think you could work on your dialogue. In some places, it feels stiff and unnatural. Again, in the second paragraph, the dialogue between the cultists feels very stilted. Try to make it sound more natural and conversational.

Overall, I think you have a great start to a story. With a little bit of editing, it could be really excellent.
