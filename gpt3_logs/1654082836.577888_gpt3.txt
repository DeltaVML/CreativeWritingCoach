PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I reach into the nest and grab the animals young, I smash its weak form into my desk, before pouring it's guts into a bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

The young dealt with, I go after it's mother; ripping free her skin, I expertly slice the flesh apart, revelling in the perfect slices that I rip free.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, the ultimate disrespect. I drop the lacerated flesh into the remains of her child, making sure they're well combined. I finish my fell combinations, with a scattering of charred oats, before throwing everything into a fire.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, at last, my chicken strips will be complete...

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opening sentence is very strong and immediately grabs the reader's attention. However, the rest of the paragraph is somewhat confusing and unclear. What exactly are you trying to describe? Is this a story about a person who is killing and cooking animals, or is there something else going on? If so, make sure to be more clear.

The second paragraph is also confusing. Why are you ripping the skin off the mother? And why do you drop the lacerated flesh into the remains of her child? Again, if there is some sort of point or symbolism to this, make sure it is clear to the reader.

The final paragraph is much clearer, and the last sentence is a nice twist. Overall, though, the story is confusing and unclear. Make sure to be more specific and detailed in your descriptions, and to clarify the point of the story.
