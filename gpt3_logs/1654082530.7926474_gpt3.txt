PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

It is a lie that we are whole.

We are legion- all of us.  A thousand impulses, a million might-have-beens, all inhabiting a single body.

We're pretty good at ignoring it.  Pretending that there's one, and only one, who holds the controls and steers the ship.  In the moment, we can feel this way.

It's easier to notice the lie when we look back- rifle through our  memories and watch helplessly as the ship of self sails in ways that we, in the here and now, find abhorrent, incomprehensible, or 'cringe'.

The question of the ship of Theseus is not whether it is the same ship.  The question is if  it makes sense to think of it all as one thing, composed as it is of a thousand parts, swapping out here and there without great consequence.

Still, it's a comforting lie.  The idea that we might be punishing an innocent person, who looks back at the crime with exactly the same horror as you...that's not helpful.  The criminal-in-the-moment may not think much of the other person who will come along later and inhabit their body, looking back in regret on their crimes, but we have precious few ways of influencing them after the fact *at all*.

We work with the tools we've got.

But it makes it all the more discomforting, to see yourself transformed, to see the lie so plainly exposed, the outer covering ripped straight down the middle.

Before, there was a man, in flesh and in form.  A man is his shape, and as a man he behaves.

Now, there is a great beast, fangs and fur and muscle and madness.  And as a beast, it behaves.  Less fearsome than foolish, but a beast nonetheless.

The terrifying bit is that everything is the same inside, before and after.  There is no magic that can warp a mind, not truly.  There doesn't *need* to be.  Given a new form, new strength, new instincts, new chemicals crawling through the body and brain, the mind adjusts, swaps in a new aspect.

It's a terrible secret that all werewolves keep- all men know, in their minds, how to be wolves.

It's horrifying enough to look upon yourself like that, to look back at your memories and wish you had done anything else.  But there's more to the lie than what you tell to *yourself*.

Because we are social creatures.  Wolves are, as well.  We create a self, and show it to the world, and take great care to make it seem alive, seem complete, seem *whole*.

We build relationships, and trust, and intimacy, and love.  And live all the while in fear, that the veil will drop, that we will be seen as we truly are- many, ever-changing, filled with as many madmen as saints.

Many a relationship has been torn asunder by a simple truth.  Ask those who have escaped the closet, who have come out as trans, how well even the closest relationships hold up in the face of an unexpected truth.

So werewolves hide.  They tell shallow lies to protect deeper ones.  They say that their loved ones would be in danger when they transform, that they might rip and maim and kill without any understanding.

In truth, a werewolf will only kill you when transformed if they would have killed you in their human form.  Wolves are social creatures, and would no more turn on their pack than we would.  The added strength and sharp claws make no difference whatever, any more than a beloved uncle would tear you apart simply because he started going to the gym.

No, werewolves hide because they are the same inside as they ever were.  It's simply a different portion of them brought to the forefront- the circumstances have changed, and so the *person* seems to change.  But they know their family, their loved ones, their friends.  They're still themselves, just with a new body and a new urge to howl and bark and piss on things.

They hide, and keep their secret.  Far, far better to be thought a monster than to be known for what you truly are.

Human.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening paragraph of your story is very strong. You immediately introduce the reader to the main idea of the story, that we are all composed of many parts. You also raise the question of whether it is helpful to think of ourselves as one thing. This is an interesting and thought-provoking opening that will make readers want to continue reading to see how you develop these ideas.

You develop your ideas well in the second paragraph. You explain how we usually ignore the fact that we are composed of many parts, and how this can be problematic when we look back on our memories and see ourselves behaving in ways that we would not approve of now. This is a very relatable experience that will resonate with many readers.

You continue to explore the implications of this idea in the third paragraph. You raise the question of whether it is helpful to think of ourselves as one thing, and explain how this can be a Comforting lie. You also introduce the idea of werewolves as an example of how a person can be transformed into something different. This is a clever way to explore the idea of transformation and its effect on our sense of self.

The fourth paragraph is also well-written. You explain how a werewolf's mind is still the same, even after they have transformed into a different form. You also raise the question of how relationships can be affected by this transformation. This is an interesting and unique perspective on the werewolf myth.

The fifth paragraph is well-written and provides a conclusion to the story. You explain how werewolves hide their true nature from the world, and how this can be a difficult secret to keep. You also provide a final thought on the idea of transformation and its effect on our sense of self. This is a thought-provoking ending that will leave readers thinking about the ideas you have explored in the story.
