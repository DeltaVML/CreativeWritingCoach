PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

My eyes widened as hair wildly grew out of Sabrina’s arms. She let out a piercing howl that echoed in our living room. 

“Please, I don’t want to be seen like this. It’s embarrassing!” pleaded Sabrina.

I reached out my hand and she howled again, her body transforming in the process. It was hard to believe that my girlfriend had transformed into the monster that now lay on the floor.

I stood there dumbfounded as she began to roll around the carpet and get hair everywhere. It would be a pain to vacuum up the next day, but I was just more in shock of what had happened.

I didn’t have much time to think though. Sabrina scurried off quickly. I tried to chase after her, but she came running back with a tennis ball in her mouth.

“Uh ok I guess this works,” I said.

I took the ball from her mouth and threw it across the room. The sounds of nails scratching up the hardwood made me cringe, but it was hard to stay mad when she ran back enthusiastically. I even smiled after throwing the ball a few times. Playing fetch like this reminded me of my old dog, Zeus, although I knew I would never tell Sabrina that. I don’t think she’d appreciate being compared to a dog, but in a way she was one just bigger and more human-like.


Unfortunately, the fetch time was short lived. Sabrina ran over to a window and started barking at a squirrel in the yard. 

“Hey, Sabrina, stop!” 

It was no use. Sabrina simply darted over to another window when I tried to shoo her away from the first one. The barking continued. My ears were reminded of what it was like to own a dog. 

I would have to think of some sort of excuse to neighbors as to why there was a dog in my house, but at that moment I just hoped the music from my headphones would drown out the barking.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening paragraph does a great job of setting up the story and drawing the reader in. I particularly like the line "I reached out my hand and she howled again, her body transforming in the process." This is a great example of showing instead of telling and it really helps set the scene.

However, the second paragraph feels a bit choppy and could be rewritten to flow better. For example, the sentence "I even smiled after throwing the ball a few times." could be moved to the beginning of the paragraph so it flows better with the rest of the sentences.

Overall, this is a great story with a unique premise. I really enjoyed reading it.
