STORY:
================================

Hmm….let’s see what we can do with this one.

……………………………………….

Jason woke up slowly. It was dark. Took him a moment to recall where he was. In bed, with his wife of seven years. Something had woken him up. Or something had woken up in him and forced him back to a state of consciousness. Either way, he was awake now and probably not going to get back to sleep. He got out of bed slowly to avoid waking his wife and went to make a cup of coffee. The time said 5:17am. As he was making his coffee, the dream he’d been having came back to him. “Weird dream,” he thought to himself. How could the whole world turn to cake? Now he remembered what woke him up. His wife had turned to cake right before his eyes. It had felt so real. “Knew i shouldn’t have eaten that last edible,” he muttered. As he turned to get his coffee from the coffeemaker, he caught a glimpse of his wife lying very still in bed. His heart started beating very fast and he broke out in sweat. A feeling of deja vu gripped him. The TV came on suddenly, lights flickered and there was a sudden gust of wind through windows that were closed a minute ago. Through all this, his wife still didn’t move a muscle. Jason had a sudden idea. He picked up a small paperweight on the kitchen counter and threw it at his wife through the bedroom door to wake her up. He’d tell her he slipped and it flew out of his hand. The paperweight flew across the room and Jason prepared to sooth his wife back to sleep the moment she woke. Except she wasn’t waking. The paperweight didn’t give the sound he was expecting from it slapping on flesh and he thought he’d missed at first. Then he looked closer and he saw that the paperweight had landed on his wife. And sunk into her body. He could see into his wife’s body and it looked like she was made of….cake? The cup of coffee slipped out of his hand and he started running towards where his wife lay on the bed. But he didn’t get far. One moment, he was running and the next, he was slipping on a hardwood floor that suddenly turned soft and mushy. And then the floor gave way and he was falling. Through cake….

“Wake up, Dad! We gotta go now or we won’t get out of the city in time!” Jason gasped and jerked upright into a sitting position. He looked around him wildly. They seemed to be in a library. The walls were made of glass and they were some distance in the air. He looked out of the windows. Buildings were toppling in the distance. “Get the hell up, Dad! We need to get out of here,” his son, Micheal, said. That was a sentiment Jason wholly agreed with. He had no idea what the hell was going on but he wanted nothing to do with it. He made to get up but there was a weight on his legs. Jason looked down and he screamed! Lying across his legs was a body. Or what looked like a body, but made of cake. But that was not made him scream. The body had the face of his wife. He looked up and saw tears streaming down the face of his son. “She’s gone, Dad,” he said.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The dream sequence was interesting and well-written. I liked the detail about the paperweight sinking into the cake-wife's body. Jason's reaction was believable and well-done.

The second half of the story, after the dream, was confusing. It wasn't clear what was happening or why. Jason's reaction to seeing his cake-wife was confusing and didn't make sense. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.

Overall, this story had potential but needed more development to be successful. I suggest focusing on clarifying the plot and providing more detail to help the reader understand what is happening.
