PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

A single grain of sugar, placed upon a leaf. That was enough to attract a butterfly to perch next to it. When that butterfly took off again, the flap of its wings was seen by a child. That child ran towards it, wanting to see a butterfly up close for the first time. They ran across the road, forgetting to look both ways. Driving on that road was a businesswoman, who had to slam her brakes to avoid hitting the child.

This caused her to be 2 seconds behind where she otherwise would've been. Far enough back to avoid getting crushed by a dying tree falling onto the road in front of her. That woman would go on to her work, and negotiate a deal between the company she worked for and another company, which would've fallen through without her.

One part of this deal was the creation of a new research and development division. One of the many people hired by this division was Mark M. White. He originally took it as a summer job, and it sparked a passion for tinkering and engineering within him. He started a hobby project of his own, an efficient electric motor. 

His work was published in the local newspaper, which found itself in the hands of a talent scout for a government project. Mark was recruited to this project, a project to build a time machine. 

After several long years, sending electrons and protons seconds into the past, they finally had a working prototype. It could send an object the size of a grain of sand up to 10 years into the past. After some thought, a grain of sugar was chosen, as it had slightly less mass, and it would be easier to keep track of, since sugar is a more rare material than sand.

The machine powered up, the grain disappeared. The screens showed the grain made it safely to its destination, though a few millimeters in front of where it was aimed. It seems to have landed upon a leaf.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

RESPONSE:

================================

The story was well-written and engaging. I particularly liked the way it ended, with the sugar grain landing on the leaf.

However, there were a few things I noticed that could be improved. First, there were a few typos, such as "towards it, wanting see a butterfly up close for the first time." These typos can be easily fixed with a spell checker or by reading the story aloud.

Second, there were a few awkward phrases, such as "The flap of its wings was seen by a child." This could be rewritten as "The child saw the butterfly's wings flapping."

Third, the story could be further improved by adding more description, such as the color of the butterfly or the child's reaction to seeing it.

Overall, the story was enjoyable and well-written. With a few minor tweaks, it could be even better.
