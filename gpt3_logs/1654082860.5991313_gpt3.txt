PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

We expected to find very little in the first few systems, what we didn’t expect was the desolated planets and husks of cities left behind. At first, we believed we had just found the unlucky few, planets that had over industrialised, or simply exhausted their resources. Soon it became clear that this wasn’t the case. 
  
It started on Gamma-2-9, believing it to be disrespectful to search the remains of civilisations we had passed by early planets once they were discovered to be barren of life. But eventually we had to investigate, too many planets were empty, or rather what we later found to be the truth: purged. 
  
On Gamma my team and I entered what seemed to be a research facility of sorts. We couldn’t make much of what we found until we hit the central control room. Somehow the power still worked, and when we turned things on, a single word appeared on every screen in the room: Run.
  
By the time we made it back to our ship, the first few had fallen to the madness. A voice spoke to them and bid them complete dreadful tasks, or so they claimed. After the first few deaths, we fled the system, believing it to be a technology we had yet to encounter. How wrong we were.
  
Each crew member that was corrupted, no… converted, had to be executed. There seemed to be no way of freeing them from the influential entities. Not every system had one of these so called ‘gods’, but the ones that did were added to an increasingly long list of off-limits systems.
  
The search goes on, but we don’t know when, or if, well ever find a safe place to call home.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening paragraph of your story is very strong, it immediately draws the reader in and creates a sense of mystery. The second paragraph is also good, it raises more questions and creates a sense of unease. I like the way you have started this story.

However, I feel that the third and fourth paragraphs could be stronger. In the third paragraph, you introduce the idea of the "gods" but you don't really explain what they are or why they are important. In the fourth paragraph, you introduce the idea of the crew members being "converted" but again, you don't really explain what this means.

I think it would be helpful to explain these concepts in more detail, so that the reader can understand the story better. For example, you could explain what the "gods" are and why they are influencing the crew members. You could also explain what the crew members are being converted into, and why this is a problem.

Overall, I think this is a very strong start to a story. I am intrigued to find out more about the "gods" and the crew members, and I look forward to reading more of your work.
