STORY:
================================

"I-... I beg your pardon, oh great precursor?" Sam, the leader of the Expedition, asked, confounded.

*"I beg your pardon, oh great precursor!",* the AI said, mockingly. "*Stop blowing smoke up my ass and tell me what you want already, so I can get back to sleep"*.

Confused, Sam looked back to his peers. Much like himself, they too were at a loss for words.

Sam tried once more. "Oh great precursor, forgive me, for I do not understand."

Rolling his eyes, the AI commenced.

*"Alright, listen up. Here's how this is gonna go. First off, the name's Max. Second, enough with the cult worship bullshit. I ain't a god, I'm a fucking robot. Lastly, you get only one question to ask me, then I'm shutting off for 100 years."*

Frightened, Sam nods, turns around and gathers his team.

"What do we do?" they asked, looking to Sam for answers.

"The elders mentioned nothing of this sort!" Sam whispered, loudly.

"Perhaps the elders put too much trust in myth," said Peter. He was the oldest  and wisest of the group. He did not wish to join the Expedition, but the King ordered him, knowing the team needed a voice of reason.

"What then do we do, Peter?" Sam asked.

"It's simple. We ask it to explain the fate of the Old World. That is, after all, what the King wants to know."

"But that's not all the King wants to know," another team member interrupted. "He wants to know where the great treasures are hidden."

"Yes," said Peter. "But the King didn't know that the great precursor grants only one question."

Sam nodded. "This is true. We will have to choose on behalf of the King, then. Do wee choose ancient knowledge or the path to riches?"

"We don't even know if these treasures are real," Peter said. "It is but a rumour. Even the great explorers of our age have but a trace of its whereabouts."

Peter leaned in towards Sam. "The King is rich enough as he is."

*"I'm waaaittiiiing!"*, the AI bellowed.

Petrified, the group slowly turned around.

*"Any day now."* The AI grew impatient. The team realized the AI wasn't going to wait around much longer.

"Go!", shouted the team, urging Sam to ask his one and only question.

Sam slowly stepped forward. Carefully, he said, "Oh great pre-.. sorry. Max. Oh great Max! I wish to know the fate of the Old World!"

\----

The King woke up to the sound of horns on a cold winter morning. The horns would only announce the arrival of very important guests, but normally, the King would receive word of such visits ahead of time. He quickly got up, and went to his window.

"Who comes at this hour?!", the King yelled from his high tower, as he struggled to put on his garments. From a distance, he could still recognize the Expedition, entering through the gates.

The King rushed down, pushing aside his servants. He mounted the first horse in the stable and rode towards the gate. His guards were right behind him, struggling to keep up.

When he arrived, he saw the Expedition being greeted by the townspeople. They were feeding them and offering blankets, as the team were visibly frail. Some members collapsed to the ground upon arriving. The King, however, paid no attention to this.

He rode up to Sam. He was sitting on a bench, cold, eating only a piece of bread given to him by a young boy.

The King greeted him. "Welcome back, Sam! I hope you fared well during your trip."

The Expedition had been gone for a little under a year. They travelled through wilderness to find the AI and suffered the losses of 3 men, including Peter.

Sam, visibly upset, said nothing.

The King, in his shortsightedness, dismissed Sam's emotions.

"Tell me, explorer," the King continued. "What have you seen?"

"We found the great precursor," Sam uttered.

The King's eyes lit up. "My heavens," he said. "Tell me, what did it say?"

"It only allowed us to ask one question, before going back to sleep for 100 years."

"And... and what did you ask it?"

"We asked it to tell us the fate of the ancients."

Disappointed, the King muttered words of anger.

Calming down, the King continued. "Well then, what did it say?"

"Nukes," Sam said.

"Nuk-... Nukes? What is this nukes?" the King said, in confusion.

"I don't know," Sam replied. "Why don't you go ask it?"

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening of your story is very confusing and hard to follow. You introduce the concept of the AI very suddenly and without much explanation. It is also hard to understand why the AI is angry and what it wants from the characters. You might want to consider rewriting the beginning of the story to make it more clear.

You do a good job of developing the characters and their relationships to each other. The dialogue is believable and helps to further the plot.

The ending of the story is confusing and abrupt. It is not clear what the AI meant by "nukes" and why the King is so upset. You might want to consider adding more information to the ending to make it more clear.
