PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

"Only the dead are immortal."

With very few exceptions (and I am not one), only the dead gain immortality. They do this through deeds and actions, the legacy they leave behind. Men like Washington and Lincon let a legacy shine, leaving a great country. Others take the easy path. Hitler killed enough people and caused enough ruckus that few will forget him. Change history, and be at the head. Having a funny mustache or being short helps too.

I took the easy way.

They locked up my corpse and left it to rot. As for me, I have just sat here waiting. I heard they were about to open the door, and based on the hushed tones, they still fear me. After all these centuries, they fear a body. why, it must be a pile of bones now! 

The guard wakes with a start- "What the hell kind of dream was that?" 

I laugh, and the guard shivers. He has no idea who's bench he sat on. He gets up and walks off. Oh how I love messing with their feeble minds. I can't wait until they dispose of that corpse, oh the confusion and panic I will cause. I may be dead, but I still have a few tricks up my sleeve...

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

================================

The opening sentence is very strong and sets up the rest of the story nicely. I like the idea of the protagonist being a dead person who is waiting for something. However, I think the second paragraph could be stronger. Instead of talking about how other dead people have become immortal, I think it would be more interesting to focus on the protagonist and what he/she is doing. For example, you could describe how the protagonist is feeling or what he/she is thinking about.

The third paragraph is good and provides some interesting information about the story. I think you could develop this further by providing more details about the guard's dream. For example, you could describe what the dream was about in more detail.

The ending of the story is good and ties everything together nicely. I think you could make it even stronger by providing more information about what the protagonist plans to do next. For example, you could describe how the protagonist is going to mess with the guard's mind.
