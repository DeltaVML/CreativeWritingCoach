PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Something prodded on the senses of It That Slumbers. Distantly, faintly, a call sounded from the depths of creation. Beasts howl in the night, and one of them is known to the unwakeable horror. Bes'ghaull spoke the names and drew in dirt the ancient signs.

Reluctantly, It That Slumbers woke, and teetered anxiously on the precipice between dream and sensibility. It sensed chill and damp and windy in short, breathy whisps. It knew the call.

It rose, with Bes'ghaull racing in front of it. Her chitinous claws clattered against the smooth floor. It stumbled and plodded up to the gateway. It slammed an appendage, ripped with tendon and bone, against the lock, and heaved the gateway open.

She ran past it, into the night. Then she stopped. She turned to look back. Gazing up into it's glossy eyes in the moonlight, she squats and poops.

"Good girl, Daisy," it says with considerable awkwardness. So acknowledged, she runs back into the gateway, to the chamber where It That Slumbers dwells until the great fire in the sky again rouses it. She lays down where It That Slumbers had slept, and stretches out horizontally across it.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The "compliment sandwich" method is a way of giving feedback that includes a compliment, followed by constructive criticism, and then ended with another compliment. This method is designed to help the recipient of the feedback to feel good about themselves while still providing them with useful information on how to improve.

First, I want to commend you for using descriptive language to set the scene and create a sense of place. I also like the way you use sensory details to engage the reader's imagination. However, there are a few things you could do to improve the flow and clarity of your writing. For example, you might want to break the story up into shorter paragraphs to make it easier to read. You might also want to clarify the relationship between It That Slumbers and Daisy. Are they friends? Family? What is the nature of their relationship?

Overall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer. I hope you will continue to work on your craft and I look forward to reading more of your work in the future.
