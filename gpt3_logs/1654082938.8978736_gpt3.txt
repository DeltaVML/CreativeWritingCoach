STORY:
================================

"Kill me."

The Minotaur smashed its club into the tiles, right where Mat had been standing a moment before. The stone splintered and flew across the room, sending onlookers scattering. Mat was now behind the Minotaur, the Sword of Dawn gleaming in his hand. A minotaur outside of its labyrinth was rare, but inside a city? Unreal. Times were getting hard. But monsters were constant. They had come after him, one after the other.

"Just kill me!"

The Minotaur wound up, throwing the club like a javelin, aimed straight at Mat's head. No way he could dodge this. Out of reflex, he held the sword in front of him, the flat of the blade facing the beast. He had done this move many times before, against humans, harpies, and even the occasional manticore. Any projectile-based foe, really. The Sword of Dawn glowed the color of the shifting sky. When the club connected, though it was three times the size of the Mat, it stopped, its momentum turning to absolutely nothing. It shattered then, projectiles the size of human heads scattering in random directions, connecting with buildings. Mat's heart thrummed, and he felt his body vibrate down to its very core. This one was strong.

"Kill me, you dumb beast!"

The Minotaur matched Mat's cry with a roar. It leaned down, horns pointed at Mat, clawed hands held out to the sides. Any of those sharp ends would instantly skewer Mat.

"Yes! Come on, do it!"

The Minotaur charged, closing the gap in between the man and beast with frightening speed. Mat moved, flowing effortlessly to a defensive stance, in a position to parry whatever sharp end approached him. As the Minotaur came within reaching distance of him, he swung -

\- only to feel the blunt end of the Minotaur's hoof strike him directly in the gut. Mat went flying, colliding with a stone wall on the other end of the square. He felt something crack, and his vision filled with spots. A breath later, and a warmth filled him, the Sword of Dawn turning the color of the moon as it lingers in the morning. Bones shifted back into place, and Mat groaned. He stood up. That hadn't happened in... ever. Since the first monster, maybe.

"That wasn't enough! Kill me, please!"

The Minotaur stood for a second, its bovine face allowing for the briefest expression of what Mat thought was shock. Whatever. It was now Mat's turn to close the gap. With speed matching that of the Minotaur's, he ran in, the Sword of Dawn slicing upwards. The minotaur brought its hard claws and muscular arms to block it, but there was no resistance. The arms fell away immediately, severed totally. Whatever townsfolk were still remaining cheered.

"Not good enough. Not good enough to end me."

Mat didn't shout this time, as he methodically sliced the legs and horns of the Minotaur, now a bleeding torso in the middle of the town square. He stepped onto its massive chest, the Sword of Dawn pointed at its throat. It rasped, dark eyes staring at Mat's tired face.

"I am... sorry... Mat. I... I tried. I will... see you, when the -"

The sword cut through Gavyn the Minotaur's neck. The Sword of Dawn pulsed a blood-like red. The brightness, the vitality, the weight of the beast in front of Mat began to wither away. As it did, the sword pulsed brighter and faster.

Right after the kill. That's when the sword gave him enough control to move. As the townsfolk chanted his name, lifted him up, hugged him, cried for him. As the world grew to love him more. Mat could only sit in mute silence. All of the time to resist, and he did nothing. Not even a 'kill me."

They had come after him, one after the other. His friends. Gavyn had been the strongest. The sword knew this, and it thrummed with a greedy joy. Not many monsters left now. It would kill them all, and relish the ones that Mat had grown with the most. It would kill them all.

And after that, who knows?

I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

RESPONSE:

================================

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some work. First, your descriptions could be more vivid. For example, when the Minotaur smashes its club into the tiles, you could describe the sound it makes, or the look on its face. Additionally, you could describe the setting in more detail, so that readers can picture the scene more clearly.

Second, your dialogue could be more natural. In particular, the dialogue between Mat and the Minotaur feels stiff and unnatural. You could try to make it more conversational, so that it sounds like two people (or a person and a beast) talking to each other.

Overall, your story is intriguing and has a lot of potential. With some more work on your descriptions and dialogue, it could be even better.
