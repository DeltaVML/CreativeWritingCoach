STORY:
================================

I always wondered what the Chaos was.
  

  
Sure, when I looked out to the horizon I saw a storm-like eruption of colors and magical energy, but what was it? It was unlike any storm I ever knew, it was ever-persistent, said to have been in that same spot for centuries, encompassing the space of a former land.
  

  
What was that land like before the Chaos? What was it like now?
  

  
I felt a kinship with the Chaos. I could not perform any magic, I was a blotch in a perfect world of magic. Just as the Chaos was seen as a blotch. Something people couldn’t understand nor control, and today I would find out what lies within.
  

  
I took a deep breath, preparing myself for what was ahead, before stepping forward into the Chaos.
  

  
I was prepared to be torn asunder by it, to be struck by magical energy, or hit by some flying piece of magical debris; but nothing happened.
  

  
I laughed with relief and excitement. They were right! Without any magic within I was immune to the Chaos. When I was pulled aside and told by the kingsguard what mission they had for me, I thought I was being sent to die. But no! While to the rest of society I may be nothing but a useless, antimagic splotch, here, here I belonged!
  

  
To my wonder, the Chaos was… beautiful. So many vibrant and vivid colors mixing and swirling. Magic soared through the air in arcs of light and energy, making wonderful sounds as it traversed. There scarcely was ever a spectacle so magnificent as the majesty of the Chaos.
  

  
I cannot say how long I wandered the Chaos, for I do not know. It felt like a stupor while I marveled at the spectacular display of magic. Though eventually I was broken from my stupor, I found something I did not expect: others.
  

  
They had developed their own community at the center of the Chaos. While one might expect the epicenter to be nothing but waste and destruction, it was quite the opposite. It flourished with magic and life! There was a golden river that shimmered gloriously, plants of such colors and variety I had never seen, and marvelous gemstones so plentiful they used it to make their dwellings. This truly was a paradise!
  

  
Shortly after I stumbled upon the village, a man approached me with a smile, “Welcome. You must be one of us.”
  

  
I blinked, “Who is us?”
  

  
He chuckled, “Those who lack magic, of course. No one else can survive within the Chaos. It is kind to us where it is cruel to others.”
  

  
I nodded, “Yes, I lack magic. What is this place?”
  

  
He grinned, “Come inside, there is a lot to discuss.”
  

  
Once I followed him inside he introduced himself as Zeris. He explained to me that long ago, a great mage had attempted to turn themselves into pure magical energy. She succeeded, but not how she expected, the Chaos was thus created. One day the kingdom sent an inhabitant without magic to find out more about the Chaos.  They saw us as expendable, likely to die in their exploration, but they did not. The first one sent in decided to tell his friend, a government man, to keep sending more antimages in. The government will presume them dead, and we can live in paradise without fear of persecution. This ruse has continued for hundreds of years, in the bounties of the Chaos. The Chaos, Zeris believes, sometimes seemed to have its own personality, acting warm or in a distant way to its inhabitants like a motherly presence. One he believes to be that great mage of old.
  

  
“What happened to antimages before the Chaos?” I asked.
  

  
He raised an eyebrow, “What do you mean?”
  

  
“What did the government do, did they persecute them?”
  

  
“I don’t know. There is no record of what happened to antimages before the Chaos. It’s almost as if they didn’t exist.”
  

  
“Do you think the government erased whatever persecution they inflicted on them from history?”
  

  
“Perhaps, though that would be difficult to prove.”
  

  
“I wish to find out. I thought myself alone in my lack of magic my whole life until I discovered this community. Now that I know that I have my own people, and that there are others, I wish to expose the truth. I owe us that much.”
  

  
“But why? We live in paradise here, we are safe.”
  

  
“Just because our corner of the world is perfect doesn’t permit us to hide away from the rest of the world’s flaws. I must take action.”
  

  
Zeris smiled, “I admire your tenacity, new blood. Perhaps I can help gather the council’s support. But you must be willing to go all the way, should we pursue this course of action.”
  

  
“I have a purpose now, I have no doubt left within me. I have to learn the truth.”

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

==========

RESPONSE:

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, your opening sentence is a bit of a cliche. Instead of starting with "I always wondered what the Chaos was," try to be more original and specific. What specifically about the Chaos made you curious?

Second, there are a few awkward phrases throughout the story. For example, you say that the Chaos "encompassing the space of a former land." This is a bit awkward and could be worded more smoothly.

Third, you have a lot of description of the Chaos, but it feels a bit overdone in places. Try to focus on the most important details and leave out the rest.

Overall, you have a good story with interesting characters and a unique setting. With a few tweaks, it could be even better.
