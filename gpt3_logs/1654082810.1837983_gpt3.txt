PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I swear that I love you. Your face glows red like an invisible man is choking you. It was always that way. Your neck is too skinny like it’s bound with some nylon rope, and your eyes pop like a bug. It isn’t far from you looking actively disfigured, like a fast food worker would trip over their words when they looked you in the eye. You are my lobster, your skin is red and oily like it’s slicked in garlic butter. I’m so hot for you I’ll boil you. You are my rotten darling, I wanna lick the craters in your face and swallow the acne. I wanna press my rotten teeth against yours until they crack. I wanna suck the piss out of you and then lick it back over you. I love you.

================================
END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

FEEDBACK:

RESPONSE:

Firstly, I want to commend you on your descriptive language. You have a real talent for making the reader visualize your characters and setting. However, there are a few areas you could improve on.

For example, you could try to be a little more concise in your writing. In the first sentence, you could say "I love you" instead of "I swear that I love you". This would make your writing flow better and be less repetitive.

 Additionally, you could try to vary your sentence structure a little more. At the moment, a lot of your sentences are quite short and simple. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but mixing up your sentence lengths a bit would add more interest to your writing.

Finally, you could try to be a little more original in your descriptions. For example, instead of saying "your eyes pop like a bug", you could say "your eyes bulge out of your head".

Overall, you have a lot of talent and potential as a writer. Keep up the good work!
