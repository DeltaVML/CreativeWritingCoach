PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

I like to watch the people as they pass by. I like to see the expressions on their faces, the way they hurry to get where they're going. I like to see the children laughing and playing, and the parents rushing to pick them up. I like to see the lovers holding hands, and I like to see the people look around them and smile, and I like to see the old people walking slowly, enjoying the day.

But my favorite thing to see is when two people are walking down the street, and they both turn their heads at the same time to look at each other, and they smile at each other, as if they are the only two people in the world.

Today, I saw a man standing at the corner of the intersection, waiting. I assumed it would be a while before he crossed. There were no cars coming down the street. It was a good time to cross. I made sure all the lights were green. I was ready for him.

He looked in all directions before he stepped off the sidewalk and began crossing the street. He knew what he was doing. He crossed at a steady pace, one foot in front of the other. He looked neither to the left nor to the right, just straight ahead.

Then he was in front of me. I watched him as he stepped away from me and crossed over to my other side. He looked at me as he passed by. He smiled. He had lovely eyes.

That's when I noticed that the car wasn't going to stop. The car was speeding down the street. It was going to hit him. He hadn't seen it coming.

He was still looking ahead, not looking to the left or to the right.

And I couldn't scream for him to run. I couldn't tell him to move. I couldn't warn him in any way. He had to hold my gaze and smile that beautiful smile, and walk across the intersection, and then I couldn't watch him any more.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opening sentence is very effective in setting the scene and introducing the reader to the narrator's hobby. However, the sentence is a bit choppy and could be smoothed out by breaking it into two shorter sentences. For example: "I like to watch the people as they pass by. I especially enjoy seeing the expressions on their faces, the way they hurry to get where they're going."

The following paragraph is well-written and effectively describes the different types of people the narrator enjoys watching. However, the paragraph would be even more effective if it included a bit more sensory detail. For example: "I like to see the children laughing and playing, and the parents rushing to pick them up. I like to see the lovers holding hands, and I like to see the people look around them and smile. I even enjoy watching the old people walking slowly and enjoying the day."

The third paragraph is also well-written. However, it would be more effective if the tension were ramped up a bit more before the climax of the story. For example, you could describe the man's actions in more detail as he crosses the street. For example: "He looked in all directions before he stepped off the sidewalk and began crossing the street. He knew what he was doing. He crossed at a steady pace, one foot in front of the other. He looked neither to the left nor to the right, just straight ahead."

The climax of the story is well-written and effectively suspenseful. However, the ending could be a bit more powerful if the narrator's reaction was described in more detail. For example: "And I couldn't scream for him to run. I couldn't tell him to move. I couldn't warn him in any way. He had to hold my gaze and smile that beautiful smile, and walk across the intersection, and then I couldn't watch him any more."
