PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

He fell. From inmeansurable heights he fell during what must have been a few treacherous seconds, yet to him felt like nothing less than an eternity of mindless thrill and torment. When the crushing hit of the fall happened, there was no solid land, only the unforgiving, ever itching bites of sand. He cried. What was a grievous scratch of pain were, to his perception, the agonizing throes of once healthy bones now shattered into brittle bits, puncturing his flesh and nerve endings to depths unprecedented. 

As he screamed in nameless suffering, he looked up to the skies, in hopes of seeing the colossal shadow of his protectors loom over his hurtful soul to comfort him, yet all he saw were the cold, dead handles of the slide's plastic steps. There was no hope for healing and a future, at least while his nerves roared damnedly hoping for the torment to stop.

As it turns out, little Jake from year 3 kindergarden mis-stepped on the playground slide, and had barely scraped his arm on break-time.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

RESPONSE:

================================

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that need work. First, your story is told from an omniscient third person point of view. This means that the reader knows everything that is happening, even Jake's thoughts and feelings. While this can be effective in some cases, it can also be confusing for the reader. It might be better to choose one character's point of view to focus on.

Second, your story is very short. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can make it difficult to develop the characters and plot. Try to add a bit more detail to help the reader understand what is happening.

Finally, your story ends abruptly. Jake's fall is described in great detail, but the resolution is very brief. What happens after Jake falls? Does he get up? Does he cry? Does he go to the hospital? This is something you will need to consider when revising your story.
