PROMPT:

I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

You know, I hadn't noticed how much she manipulated me into doing these things.

The way she looked at me with a big innocent smile, how she laughed as she walked through the field of dandelions. I watched the old whispers of forgotten and untold wishes drift past her, and I couldn't help but think of what creatures were crushed underneath her feet. The littlest of bugs, the tiniest springtails and ants in tandem with a scatter of butterfly wings that tried to escape the net; all tried to run from my daughter.

And then there was me.

The most despised thing a bug could witness.

If a bug could dream, it could never fathom what I did to them.

An invisible prison was combined with a poison that quickly drifted into its book-lungs along with a frozen chamber, dark and cold to lull any being to eternal sleep. A gentle nudge into a foul tube full of what looked like water, or even worse, a crucifixion upon my walls.

And I had many of them.

So many tiny bugs that were crucified, arms splayed to embrace the skies, to be watched and observed by unknown beings that couldn't be understood by even the simplest of minds.

But that was just my job.

END STORY



I will now give you one or two paragraphs of critical feedback to improve your prose and style, I will also use the "compliment sandwich" method of feedback.

RESPONSE:

================================

One way to improve your prose would be to focus on your sentence structure. In this story, many of the sentences are choppy and could be combined to create longer, more flowing sentences. For example, the first sentence could be combined with the second sentence: "I hadn't noticed how much she manipulated me into doing these things until I saw the way she looked at me." This would create a smoother, more flowing sentence.

Another way to improve your prose would be to focus on your use of adjectives and adverbs. In this story, there are several instances where you could choose a more specific or interesting adjective or adverb. For example, instead of saying "the old whispers of forgotten and untold wishes", you could say "the ancient whispers of forgotten and untold wishes". This would add more depth and interest to your writing.
