================================

The story started out strong with the protagonist's thoughts about their opponent. I liked the use of classical music to help the protagonist think things through and the switch to DDR when things got hectic. However, I felt like the story lost a bit of steam when the protagonist started listing off different types of music. It felt a bit clunky and interrupted the flow of the story.

The ending was also a bit abrupt and anti-climactic. I would suggest adding a bit more description and detail to make the ending more satisfying. Overall, this was a well-written story with a few minor hiccups.
