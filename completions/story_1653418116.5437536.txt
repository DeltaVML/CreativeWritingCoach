Your story is well-written and engaging. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, your description of the protagonist's illness is very graphic and may be too much for some readers. You may want to tone it down a bit.

Second, the dialogue between the protagonist and the other character could be more natural. It sounds a bit stilted and forced in places.

Overall, this is a well-written story with a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
