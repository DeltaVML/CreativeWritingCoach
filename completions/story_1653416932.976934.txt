The beginning of your storyhooks the reader and makes them want to read more. However, the story then delves into a lot of exposition about APCD, which interrupts the flow of the story. Try to be more concise in your explanation of the disorder and its effects, and get to the action of the story more quickly.

Your description of the steps to take in order to help a sibling with APCD are clear and helpful. However, the story then abruptly ends. Make sure to conclude your story more fully, tying up any loose ends and providing a satisfying resolution for the reader.
