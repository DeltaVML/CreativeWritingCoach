Your story raises some interesting questions about free will and what it means to be alive. However, the delivery of these ideas is somewhat heavy-handed and could be improved. For example, the use of the word "meme" is repeated a few too many times and feels a bit forced. Additionally, the dialogue between the AI and the explorers could be tighter and more natural. Finally, the ending of the story feels abrupt and unfinished. Overall, there is potential in this story, but it needs some refinement.
