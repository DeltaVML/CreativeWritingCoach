Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that need improvement. For example, your dialogue could be more natural and realistic. In addition, your story could benefit from more description, especially when it comes to the seeress's appearance and the protagonist's powers. Overall, though, you have a solid foundation for a good story.
