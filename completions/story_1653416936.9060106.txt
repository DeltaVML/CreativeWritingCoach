Your story had some good elements, but there were also areas that could be improved. For example, the dialogue was sometimes stilted and unnatural. In addition, the plot was a bit predictable.

One way to improve the dialogue is to make it more natural and realistic. One way to do this is to have the characters speak in contractions. For example, instead of saying "I am going to the store," the character could say, "I'm going to the store." This small change can make a big difference in the flow of the dialogue.

In addition, try to make the plot less predictable. One way to do this is to add twists and turns that the reader doesn't see coming. This will keep them engaged with the story and guessing what will happen next.
