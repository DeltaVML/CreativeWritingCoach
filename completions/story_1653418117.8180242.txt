Your story has a lot of potential! I love the idea of exploring the relationship between a Fae and their human thrall. I think you did a great job of showing the contrast between the two characters.

However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, I think you could work on your dialogue. It feels a little stilted and unnatural in places. Second, I think you could add a bit more description to your setting and characters. Right now, the story feels a little sparse in terms of description.

Overall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer! I would encourage you to keep writing and exploring your creativity.
