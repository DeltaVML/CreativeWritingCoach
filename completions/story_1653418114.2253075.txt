The opening of this story is very strong, setting the scene and mood perfectly. I love the use of sensory details to make the reader feel like they are there in the village with Claire. The only suggestion I would make is to be careful with your use of adjectives. In general, good writing uses strong verbs rather than adjectives to describe actions and objects. For example, "The air is heavy with the scent of an oncoming storm" could be rewritten as "The air hangs thick with the scent of an oncoming storm." Just be careful not to overdo it with the adjectives.

The second paragraph is also well written, providing more details about Claire and the setting. I love the line "In the night, the mind plays tricks with the shadows, shapes take form for a second before vanishing, reality and fantasy merge together." This is a great example of showing rather than telling the reader what is going on.

The third paragraph is where I start to have some concerns. The sentence "Trees border the path, the leaves rustle gently under the wind as she walks upwards" is a great example of using strong verbs to describe the action. However, the following sentence "Atop the hill, a much-needed fresh breeze plays through her hair and invigorates a horde of insects hidden in the grass" feels a bit overwritten. I would suggest cutting out the adjectives "much-needed" and "fresh" to simplify the sentence.

The fourth paragraph is well written, providing more details about the setting and Claire's thoughts.

The fifth paragraph is where the story starts to lose me. The dialogue between Claire and the man feels stilted and unnatural. I would suggest rewriting this dialogue to make it sound more natural. Additionally, the sentence "She didn't like her night outings to be cadenced by Fifi's loud steps, it scared the owls and muted the insects" feels a bit choppy and could be rewritten to flow better.

The sixth paragraph is well written, providing more details about the setting and Fifi.

The seventh paragraph is where the story really starts to lose me. The dialogue between Claire and the man feels stilted and unnatural. Additionally, the sentence "Fifi certainly isn't, and his teeth sinking into the tender flesh of a fragile neck are ample proof of it, the realest experience tonight for the poor man, and his last too" is overly graphic and disturbing. I would suggest cutting this sentence out or toning it down.

Overall, this story has a lot of potential but needs some work in terms of dialogue and sentence structure. I would suggest reading over your story again and making sure that the dialogue sounds natural and that your sentences are not overly complicated. Additionally, be careful with your use of adjectives. Good writing uses strong verbs to describe actions and objects.
