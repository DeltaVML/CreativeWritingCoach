First, I want to commend you for having a clear understanding of the different perspectives of the devil's origin. I think you did a good job of explaining the Japanese perspective of the devil, and how a cynic could not be a hero. However, I think you could have been more concise in your explanation. I also think you could have given more examples to support your claims. For example, you could have given an example of a cynic being a hero, or you could have given an example of a realist being a hero. Overall, I think you did a good job of explaining the prompt, and I think you could have been more concise and given more examples to support your claims.
