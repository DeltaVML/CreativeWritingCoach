================================

You have a lot of good ideas in this piece, and you make some valid points about income inequality in America. However, your writing style is very choppy and difficult to read. You also switch from first person to third person midway through the piece, which is confusing for the reader.

I suggest you revise your piece to make it more concise and easier to read. You may also want to choose one point of view and stick with it throughout the piece.
