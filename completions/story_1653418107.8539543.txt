================================

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that could be improved. First, your dialogue feels a little stilted and unnatural. Make sure to have your characters speak in a way that sounds natural and realistic. Additionally, your story could benefit from more description. Use vivid language to describe your characters, setting, and action. Finally, watch your grammar and punctuation. Make sure to proofread your work before submitting it.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. Keep up the good work!
