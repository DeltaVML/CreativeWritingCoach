The opening sentence of your story is very intriguing and sets up the reader for the rest of the tale. However, I feel that the dialogue in the second paragraph could be tighter and more natural. It feels a bit stilted and forced in places.

You have a strong voice and a clear writing style. I like the way you use humor to offset the more serious moments in the story.

The ending of the story is very powerful and leaves the reader with a lot to think about.
