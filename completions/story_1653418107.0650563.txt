Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could be improved. First, your sentences are often choppy and could be combined to create smoother, more flowing prose. Additionally, you could work on developing your characters more fully - right now they feel a bit one-dimensional. Finally, watch your grammar and punctuation - there are a few errors throughout the story.

Overall, you have a solid foundation for a good story. With a few tweaks, it could be really great.
