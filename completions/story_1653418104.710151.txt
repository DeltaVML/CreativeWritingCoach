First, I'd like to commend you on your use of descriptive language and your ability to set a scene. Your opening paragraph is particularly evocative. However, there are a few areas where your prose could be improved. For example, in the second paragraph, you might want to consider using stronger verbs to describe the protagonist's actions. Additionally, in the third paragraph, you might want to clarify what the protagonist is wondering about.

In general, I think your story has potential, but it might benefit from a bit more development in terms of plot and character. For instance, it might be helpful to give the reader more information about the protagonist's background and why they are testing their powers. Additionally, the story might be more suspenseful if the reader knew more about the consequences of the protagonist's actions.
