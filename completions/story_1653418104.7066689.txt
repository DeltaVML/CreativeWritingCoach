The opening paragraph is very strong, it immediately introduces the concept of the story and gives the reader a sense of what is to come. The second paragraph is also well done, it gives concrete examples of the gifts that other members of the protagonist's family have received.

However, the third paragraph feels a bit choppy and could be rewritten to flow more smoothly. Additionally, the end of the story feels rushed and could be expanded upon to provide more resolution.

In general, the story is well-written and engaging. The concept is unique and interesting. Keep up the good work!
