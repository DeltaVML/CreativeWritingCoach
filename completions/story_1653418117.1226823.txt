The opening of your story is intriguing and sets up the reader for an exciting tale. However, the story quickly loses momentum and becomes confusing. It is difficult to follow the plot and the characters seem one-dimensional. In addition, the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying.

There are some bright spots in your story, however. The descriptions of the intergalactic war are well done and add a sense of scale to the story. In addition, the idea of humans fighting gods is original and creates a sense of suspense.

Overall, there is room for improvement in this story. With some additional editing and development, it has the potential to be a great short story.
