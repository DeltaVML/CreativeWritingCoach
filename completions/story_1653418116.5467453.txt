================================

One way to improve your prose would be to focus on your sentence structure. In this story, many of the sentences are choppy and could be combined to create longer, more flowing sentences. For example, the first sentence could be combined with the second sentence: "I hadn't noticed how much she manipulated me into doing these things until I saw the way she looked at me." This would create a smoother, more flowing sentence.

Another way to improve your prose would be to focus on your use of adjectives and adverbs. In this story, there are several instances where you could choose a more specific or interesting adjective or adverb. For example, instead of saying "the old whispers of forgotten and untold wishes", you could say "the ancient whispers of forgotten and untold wishes". This would add more depth and interest to your writing.
