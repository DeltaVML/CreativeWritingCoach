The opening of your story is very strong--you immediately establish a clear and compelling voice, and set up a fascinating premise. I'm intrigued to find out more about this character and their unique situation.

That said, there are a few areas where your story could be further polished. First, watch out for awkward phrases like "the screams of the people around me as they were consumed by fire." A smoother way to phrase this would be something like "the screams of the people around me as the flames consumed them."

Second, be careful of using too many clich√©s. For example, the phrase "one small conversation at a time" is a bit overused and could be replaced with something more original.

Finally, watch your grammar and punctuation. There are a few errors in this story, such as misplaced commas and incorrect verb tenses. A little bit of proofreading can go a long way in making your story more polished and professional.

Overall, you have a strong start to a compelling story. With a few tweaks, it could be even better. Keep up the good work!
