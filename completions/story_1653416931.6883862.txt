This story has potential, but it needs work in order to be truly successful. Here are some specific suggestions:

-The opening scene is confusing and could be clarified. What mountain is the narrator referring to? Why are they taking sedatives?

-The story jumps around a bit too much. There should be a clearer focus and linear progression.

-The characters are not well developed and feel one-dimensional. The reader should know more about them in order to care about what happens to them.

-The ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. What happened to the tall man in black? Why did the narrator walk into the bar? These questions should be answered in order to give the story a sense of closure.
