The opening sentence is very effective in setting the scene and introducing the reader to the narrator's hobby. However, the sentence is a bit choppy and could be smoothed out by breaking it into two shorter sentences. For example: "I like to watch the people as they pass by. I especially enjoy seeing the expressions on their faces, the way they hurry to get where they're going."

The following paragraph is well-written and effectively describes the different types of people the narrator enjoys watching. However, the paragraph would be even more effective if it included a bit more sensory detail. For example: "I like to see the children laughing and playing, and the parents rushing to pick them up. I like to see the lovers holding hands, and I like to see the people look around them and smile. I even enjoy watching the old people walking slowly and enjoying the day."

The third paragraph is also well-written. However, it would be more effective if the tension were ramped up a bit more before the climax of the story. For example, you could describe the man's actions in more detail as he crosses the street. For example: "He looked in all directions before he stepped off the sidewalk and began crossing the street. He knew what he was doing. He crossed at a steady pace, one foot in front of the other. He looked neither to the left nor to the right, just straight ahead."

The climax of the story is well-written and effectively suspenseful. However, the ending could be a bit more powerful if the narrator's reaction was described in more detail. For example: "And I couldn't scream for him to run. I couldn't tell him to move. I couldn't warn him in any way. He had to hold my gaze and smile that beautiful smile, and walk across the intersection, and then I couldn't watch him any more."
