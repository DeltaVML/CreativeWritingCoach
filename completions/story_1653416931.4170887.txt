This is a lovely piece that captures a moment in time in a very poetic way. However, there are a few things that could be improved to make it even more effective.

Firstly, there is some awkward phrasing in places that could be smoothed out. For example, in the second paragraph, consider rewording the sentence that begins "I like to see..." to something like "I enjoy observing...". This will make the language flow more smoothly.

In addition, there is a bit of a choppy feel to the piece as a whole. Breaking it up into shorter paragraphs would help to create a more natural rhythm and make it easier to read.

Finally, the ending could be stronger. Perhaps the author could describe the man's expression as he realizes the car is not going to stop, or the sound of the impact. This would add a bit more tension and suspense to the ending and leave the reader with a more powerful image.
