The beginning of your story is very strong, you set the scene well and introduce the main character. I particularly like the last line of the first paragraph "I am the vengeful hare at night, and by day I am Kohaku Yamazaki." This line is very evocative and gives the reader a good sense of who the protagonist is.

You use strong imagery throughout the story, which creates a very vivid picture for the reader. In particular, the image of the protagonist's mother being beheaded is very powerful.

The story flows well and is easy to read. You have a good sense of pacing, which keeps the reader engaged.

You have created a very interesting and unique protagonist. I like the idea of a monster hunter who is also a monster. This gives the story an added layer of depth.

The ending is very strong and brings the story to a satisfying close. I particularly like the line "And so I will continue fighting, until the day when Shion chooses to free me from living. Until we can be together in the spirit world." This line is very emotive and gives the reader a sense of the protagonist's resolve.
