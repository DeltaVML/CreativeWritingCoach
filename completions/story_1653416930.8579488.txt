Your story has a unique premise which I found intriguing. I liked the idea of a person sitting down to dinner with Father Time and his family. However, the story felt a bit choppy and disjointed in places. In particular, the dialogue felt stiff and unnatural. I would suggest working on making the dialogue sound more natural and flowing.

In terms of your prose, there were a few awkward phrases and choppy sentences. I would recommend reading your work aloud to yourself to catch any awkward phrasing. Overall, though, your story was enjoyable and had a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
