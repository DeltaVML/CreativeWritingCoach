The opening of this story is very strong, and really pulls the reader in. The use of short, declarative sentences is effective in conveying the urgency of the situation. I also like the way the protagonist is immediately established as the leader of the team.

However, there are a few issues with the second half of the story. Firstly, the dialogue feels stilted and unnatural. It sounds like the characters are reciting lines, rather than having a conversation. Secondly, the protagonist's inner monologue feels out of place and distracting. It breaks up the action and slows down the pacing of the story.

Overall, this is a strong story with a lot of potential. With a few tweaks, it could be even better.
