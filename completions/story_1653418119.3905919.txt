================================

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that need work. First, your opening sentence is a bit confusing. It's not clear who the "anyone" is that Vulpira could kill, and why she would want to kill them. Second, your story could use more description. I felt like I was just being told what was happening, without getting a sense of the characters or the setting. Finally, your dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. Work on making your dialogue sound more like how people actually talk.
