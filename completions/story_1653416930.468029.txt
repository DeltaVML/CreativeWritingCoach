The opening of your story is very strong, and immediately sets a tense and suspenseful tone. I love the descriptions of the factory and the way the light plays off the machinery. However, I felt that the story lost a bit of momentum in the middle, when Kate is exploring the factory. It might help to focus on one or two key images or scenes, rather than trying to describe the whole factory in detail. 

The ending of the story is very effective, and the image of the door slamming shut is particularly chilling. I think you did a great job of building suspense and creating a sense of unease in the reader.
