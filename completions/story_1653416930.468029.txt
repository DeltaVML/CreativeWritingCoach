In your story, the protagonist, Kate, struggles to open a padlock on a factory door. The key fits, but the mechanism is rusty and refuses to budge. As she struggles, she cuts her thumb. 

The rust catches the web of her thumb and tears the skin. "Hell!" She jerks away and tries to find a painless way to hold her hand, but finds that the padlock is too rusty to move. She decides to abandon her inheritance and go to the clinic for a tetanus booster. 

As she steps inside the factory, she sees a black cat and begins to take pictures. She's excited to explore the factory, but becomes afraid when she hears noises and doesn't know where they're coming from. The factory is full of broken cars and machinery, and she's constantly stepping on glass. 

When the chains creep back through the handles of the lock, and the lock clicks shut on its own, she's too far away to hear. The only thing she knows is that she's lost her phone and the flashlight. When the window in the entrance of the factory shatters, she's the only one left to hear.
