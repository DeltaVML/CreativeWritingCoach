The opening of your story is very strong, I like the way you set the scene and introduce the protagonist. The description of the factory is also very evocative and creates a strong sense of place. However, there are a few small things you could do to improve your style. For example, you could use more concrete images and sensory detail to bring the reader into the story. For example, you could describe the sound of the padlock rattling, or the smell of rust and grease in the factory.

You have done a great job of creating a sense of tension and foreboding in the story. However, there are a few places where you could be more concise. For example, you could cut some of the dialogue in the second paragraph, or focus on one or two senses in the description of the factory.

The ending of the story is very strong and leaves the reader with a sense of unease.
