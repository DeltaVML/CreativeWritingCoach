================================

The opening of your story is intriguing and sets up the reader for an interesting ride. You use strong description to paint a picture of your protagonist and his antagonist. I especially like the detail about the "infinity eyes" which creates a sense of unease and mystery.

However, there are a few areas where your story could be improved. First, your dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. Make sure to have your characters speak in a way that feels true to their personality and situation. Secondly, you may want to consider adding a bit more tension and conflict to your story. Right now it feels like the characters are simply talking and not really going anywhere.

Overall, you have a strong story with interesting characters. With a few tweaks, it could be even better.
