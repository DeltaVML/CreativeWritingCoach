The first few sentences are a bit choppy and could be rewritten to flow better. For example, the sentence "Still on the high of graduating together with masters from Georgetown" could be rewritten as "Still riding the high of graduating with their masters from Georgetown".

The story has good potential, but there are a few areas that could be improved. For example, the dialogue could be more natural and less stiff. Additionally, the story could be proofread for grammar errors. Overall, however, this is a strong story with good potential.
