The beginning of the story is very promising, and I like the idea of the two friends going on a road trip. However, the story quickly loses momentum in the middle and becomes quite confusing. I'm not quite sure what is going on with the factory or the town, and the ending is very abrupt.

There are also a few technical issues with the writing. For example, you use the word "dyspathy" which is not a real word. You also have several typos throughout the story. I would recommend proofreading your work more carefully in the future.

Overall, there is potential here, but the story needs more focus and clarity. I would recommend revising it before submitting it anywhere.
