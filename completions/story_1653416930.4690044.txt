1. The opening sentence is vague and does not set up the story well. A more specific and interesting opening would be better.

2. The use of dialogue is good, but there are some awkward phrases that could be revised.

3. The ending is abrupt and leaves the reader wanting more. A more satisfying conclusion would be better.
