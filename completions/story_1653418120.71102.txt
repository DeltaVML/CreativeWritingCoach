================================

The story started off strong with an interesting hook. I was immediately engaged and wanted to know more about the girl and her powers. However, the story lost its momentum in the middle and became confusing. I wasn't sure what the protagonist's goal was, or what was at stake. The ending was also confusing and abrupt.

There were also some issues with the prose. The sentences were often choppy and awkward. I would suggest rewriting some of the sentences to make them smoother and more flowing. Additionally, there were some errors with grammar and punctuation. I would suggest proofreading the story carefully to catch these errors.

Overall, there is a lot of potential in this story, but it needs some work to reach its full potential. I would suggest rewriting and revising it to tighten the plot and improve the prose.
