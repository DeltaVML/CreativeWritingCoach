Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that could be improved. For starters, your story is very choppy and could use some more transitions to connect the different scenes. Additionally, your story feels very rushed and could use some more description to slow down the pace and allow readers to fully immerse themselves in the story. Finally, your ending feels abrupt and could use some more development to tie up loose ends and leave readers with a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, there is a lot of potential in your story, but it needs some work in terms of transitions, description, and development.
