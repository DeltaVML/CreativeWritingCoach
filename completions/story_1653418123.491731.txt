================================

The opening of this story is very promising, you set the scene well and introduce the main character. However, there are a few awkward phrases and choppy sentences. For example, "It doesn't matter; it's just a simple healing charm. He should be able to handle this, he should... but there'a something in the room that scares him." This could be rewritten as "It's just a simple healing charm, he should be able to handle this, but there's something in the room that scares him."

Another issue is that the story feels very short and choppy. It reads more like a series of events rather than a cohesive story. I would recommend adding more description and detail to flesh out the scenes. For example, you could describe the smell in the room in more detail, or the noise of the crowd.

Overall, this is a promising start to a story. With some revision, it could be turned into a really good piece of writing.
