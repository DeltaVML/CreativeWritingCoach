The beginning of your story is very strong. You immediately set the scene and introduce the conflict. I like the way you describe the amphitheater and the vampires. However, the dialogue in the story feels stilted and unnatural. The characters sound like they are reading from a script instead of having a conversation. I would suggest revise the dialogue to make it sound more natural.

In addition, the story feels very heavy-handed with the allegory. The characters are very one-dimensional and the plot is very predictable. I would suggest adding some more depth to the characters and making the plot more complex.
