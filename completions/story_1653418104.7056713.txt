Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, your opening sentence is a bit choppy and could be revised for clarity. Additionally, your use of description is sometimes helpful but at other times it feels like you are trying too hard to be poetic and it takes away from the story. Lastly, your dialogue could be more natural and less stilted. Overall, there is a lot of potential in your story and with some revision it could be truly excellent.
