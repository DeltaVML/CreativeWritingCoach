Your story has potential, but there are some areas that need improvement. First, your dialogue sounds stiff and unnatural. Try to make your characters sound more like real people by giving them distinct voices and speech patterns. Second, your descriptions could be more vivid and interesting. Use more concrete images and sensory details to bring your scenes to life. Finally, watch your pacing. Make sure your story builds tension and suspense gradually, leading up to a climax that is both unexpected and believable.

Overall, you have a good start here. With some revision, this could be a really enjoyable read.
