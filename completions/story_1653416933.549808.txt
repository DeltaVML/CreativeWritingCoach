Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that need improvement. First, your dialogue could be more natural. It often sounds stilted and unnatural. Second, you need to work on your descriptions. They are often short and lack detail. Finally, your story could benefit from a more linear structure. It feels a bit scattered and disjointed in places.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. With some practice and revision, you could produce some really great work.
