================================

Your story has potential, but there are some areas that need work. First, you need to work on your dialogue. It sounds stiff and unnatural. Second, your characters need more development. They feel one-dimensional. Finally, your plot needs more tension and conflict. Right now, it feels slow and predictable.

On the positive side, I like your use of description. Your writing is clear and concise. And you have a good handle on grammar and punctuation. Overall, there is potential here. With some revision, your story could be really good.
