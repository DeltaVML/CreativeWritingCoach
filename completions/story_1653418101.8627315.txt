The dream sequence was interesting and well-written. I liked the detail about the paperweight sinking into the cake-wife's body. Jason's reaction was believable and well-done.

The second half of the story, after the dream, was confusing. It wasn't clear what was happening or why. Jason's reaction to seeing his cake-wife was confusing and didn't make sense. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.

Overall, this story had potential but needed more development to be successful. I suggest focusing on clarifying the plot and providing more detail to help the reader understand what is happening.
