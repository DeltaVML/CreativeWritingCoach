The opening scene of your story was very strong and well-written, I was immediately hooked into the story. However, the rest of the story did not live up to the opening scene. The writing became choppy and difficult to follow. There were also several typos and grammatical errors.

I did like the idea of the story and the concept was interesting. However, the execution was not up to par. I suggest you spend more time editing and revising your story before submitting it for publication.
