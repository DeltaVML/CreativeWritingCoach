================================

The story has potential, but there are a few areas that need improvement. First, the dialogue feels stiff and unnatural. Second, the story is told from the perspective of the Immortal Mage, but it is difficult to understand his motivations. Why does he want to curse the races? Is he simply power-hungry, or is there more to his story?

The story also feels rushed, as if the author is trying to cram too much into a short space. I would suggest slowing down the pace and focusing on developing the characters and their motivations.

Overall, there is potential here, but the story needs more development.
