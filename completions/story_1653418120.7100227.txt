The opening of this story is excellent, it immediately establishes the two characters and their relationship to each other. It also raises a sense of foreboding and tension which is carried throughout the story.

However, there are a couple of areas which could be improved. Firstly, the dialogue could be tightened up in places. For example, the exchange between Dr. Andrews and Dr. Betel could be shortened to:

"Why are you letting subject 14 call you mommy?" Dr Betel asked.

"Are you an idiot, Larry?" Dr Andrews replied.

This would help to keep the pace of the story moving.

Secondly, there are a couple of places where the author tells rather than shows. For example, the line "Everyone who called him that is dead" would be more effective if it was shown through the characters' actions and dialogue.

Overall, this is a very well-written story with a strong opening. With a few tweaks, it could be even better.
