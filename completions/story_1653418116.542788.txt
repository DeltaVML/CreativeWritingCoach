================================

The opening of this story is very strong and evocative. We immediately feel sympathy for the protagonist and feel his anxiety and confusion. The use of detail in the description of the store is also excellent. Where this story falters slightly is in the shift from the mother to the stranger. This change is not entirely believable and feels abrupt. Furthermore, the dialogue feels stilted and unnatural. With a few small tweaks, this could be an excellent short story.
