================================

The opening of this story is very strong, it immediately pulls the reader in with a sense of urgency and foreboding. However, the ending feels a bit abrupt and unfinished, it might be worth considering extending it a bit further.

The use of music as a weapon against the protagonist's nemesis is a clever and original idea, and the execution is well done. However, there are a few clunky phrases throughout the story that could be smoothed out, for example; "He is stronger than me. Faster than me." could be changed to "He is stronger and faster than me."

Overall, this is a well-written and original story with a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
