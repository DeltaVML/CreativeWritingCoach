The beginning of your story is confusing. It's not entirely clear who the protagonist is or what is happening. Try to be more specific and clear in your descriptions.

Your use of dialogue is good, but there are some errors. Make sure to use proper grammar and punctuation when writing dialogue.

The ending of your story is good, but it feels abrupt. Try to tie up loose ends and give the reader a sense of closure.
