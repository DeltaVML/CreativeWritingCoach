The opening of your story is intriguing and makes the reader want to know more. You set up the conflict well and hint at the protagonist's frustration with the superhero bureaucracy. However, the story feels a bit scattered after the opening and could use more focus. For instance, you could provide more detail about the protagonist's experiences as a superhero and how the bureaucracy began to wear on them.

You have a strong voice and you're obviously passionate about your subject matter. However, the story feels a bit like a rant and could use more development. For instance, you could explore the reasons behind the protagonist's actions more deeply. What motivates them to keep fighting even when society has turned against them?

Overall, you have a strong story with interesting potential. I would recommend focusing more on developing the conflict and the protagonist's motivations.
