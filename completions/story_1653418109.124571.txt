================================

Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that need improvement. First, your opening sentence is a bit choppy and could be smoother. Additionally, your use of adjectives and description could be more concise and vivid. For example, instead of saying "I felt my muscles become smoother," you could say "I felt my muscles relax."

That being said, you have a good grasp of story structure and your use of sensory detail is excellent. Overall, with a few revisions, this could be a great story.
