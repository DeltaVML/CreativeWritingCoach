================================

The opening of your story is very strong. You give just enough backstory to provide context without bogging down the narrative. The use of sensory detail is also very effective in setting the scene. However, there are a few places where your grammar could be improved. For example, you use the word "but" at the beginning of a sentence when you should use " however". There are also a few places where you could use stronger verbs to add more impact to your writing.

Overall, you have created a very atmospheric and engaging story. Well done.
