The opening of this story is very strong, and immediately sets up a tense and suspenseful situation. You do a great job of describing the scene and making the reader feel like they are there.

However, the ending of the story falls flat. It is very anti-climactic and does not live up to the tension that was built up in the beginning. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, it just feels like a cheap joke.

One way to make the ending more impactful would be to have the monarch be more threatening, or have a more serious consequence for the protagonist's actions. As it is, the ending just feels like a cop-out.
