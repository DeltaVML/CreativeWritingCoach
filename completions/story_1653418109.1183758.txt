================================

The story is fun and quirky, with a great ending. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, the opening sentence is a bit confusing. It might be better to start with something simpler, like "I had stopped count of how many evil-doers I had stopped."

Second, throughout the story, there is a lot of telling, and not enough showing. For example, in the second paragraph, it would be better to describe the different types of people you've stopped, rather than just listing them.

Third, the story feels a bit choppy in places. It might flow better if it were shorter, or if there were more connective tissue between the different scenes.

Overall, this is a fun and original story with a great ending. With a few revisions, it could be even better.
