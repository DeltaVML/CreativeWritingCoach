Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few things you could work on to make it even better. First, watch your sentence structure. Sometimes your sentences are choppy and difficult to read. Second, try to be more concise with your words. Sometimes you use too many words when one or two would suffice. Third, watch your point of view. You sometimes slip into second person point of view, which can be confusing for readers. Overall, though, you have a great story with interesting characters and a unique premise. Keep up the good work!
