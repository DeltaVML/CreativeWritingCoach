Your story has a lot of potential, but there are areas that need improvement. One issue is that your story is choppy and difficult to follow in places. For example, the sentence "While individual *gifts*, as many came to call them, were amenable to scientific analysis (and, in fact, brought many breakthroughts of their own), the serum itself was an absolute mystery." is confusing and could be rewritten more clearly. Additionally, your story would benefit from more description and sensory detail. For example, you could describe the "awakening" scene in more detail to help the reader feel more connected to the character's experience. Overall, there is a lot of potential in your story, and with some revision, it could be really strong.
