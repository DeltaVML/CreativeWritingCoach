================================

The story is well-plotted and has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The characters are well-developed and the dialogue is natural. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, the story is told from multiple points of view, which can be confusing for readers. It might be better to focus on one point of view, such as Fiona or Jerry.

Second, the story could be tightened up in places. For example, in the second paragraph, there is a lot of description of the scene that could be cut.

Third, the ending is a bit abrupt. It might be better to end the story with Fiona and Jerry's reaction to the supercomputer's message, or with the agents on Mars.

Overall, this is a strong story with potential. With some revision, it could be even better.
