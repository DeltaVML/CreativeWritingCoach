================================

The beginning of your story is very promising, I like the way you establish the setting and introduce the characters. However, the dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. I would recommend working on that.

The plot takes an interesting turn when Robert refuses Chale's advances. I like the suspense you create here.

The ending is very shocking and gruesome. I think you did a good job of creating a sense of horror.
