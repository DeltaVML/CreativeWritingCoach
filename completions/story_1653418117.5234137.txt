================================

Your story has potential, but there are some areas that could be improved. For example, your dialogue could be more realistic and natural. In the first sentence, Errod's dialogue sounds like something a person would actually say. However, in the second sentence, his dialogue feels stiff and unnatural. It sounds like he's giving a lecture, rather than having a conversation. Try to make your dialogue sound more like how people actually speak to each other.

Another area that could be improved is your description. In the second paragraph, you give a brief description of the P=NP problem. However, this description is too technical and difficult to understand. Try to make your description more accessible to the average reader.

Overall, your story has potential. With some revision, it could be quite good.
