1. The opening of the story could be stronger. Perhaps start with a more action-packed or intriguing scene to hook readers in.

2. The story is told from a very close third person perspective, which could be confusing for some readers. It might be better to choose either a first person or more distant third person perspective.

3. There are some awkward phrases and choppy sentences throughout the story. Try to smooth out the prose for a more polished effect.

4. The ending of the story is rather abrupt and unsatisfying. Perhaps consider extending the ending or adding a more definitive conclusion.
