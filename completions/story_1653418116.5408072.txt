Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that need work. First, your story is told from an omniscient third person point of view. This means that the reader knows everything that is happening, even Jake's thoughts and feelings. While this can be effective in some cases, it can also be confusing for the reader. It might be better to choose one character's point of view to focus on.

Second, your story is very short. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can make it difficult to develop the characters and plot. Try to add a bit more detail to help the reader understand what is happening.

Finally, your story ends abruptly. Jake's fall is described in great detail, but the resolution is very brief. What happens after Jake falls? Does he get up? Does he cry? Does he go to the hospital? This is something you will need to consider when revising your story.
