The opening paragraph of your story is very strong, it immediately draws the reader in and creates a sense of mystery. The second paragraph is also good, it raises more questions and creates a sense of unease. I like the way you have started this story.

However, I feel that the third and fourth paragraphs could be stronger. In the third paragraph, you introduce the idea of the "gods" but you don't really explain what they are or why they are important. In the fourth paragraph, you introduce the idea of the crew members being "converted" but again, you don't really explain what this means.

I think it would be helpful to explain these concepts in more detail, so that the reader can understand the story better. For example, you could explain what the "gods" are and why they are influencing the crew members. You could also explain what the crew members are being converted into, and why this is a problem.

Overall, I think this is a very strong start to a story. I am intrigued to find out more about the "gods" and the crew members, and I look forward to reading more of your work.
