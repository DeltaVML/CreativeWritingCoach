Your story is very imaginative and well-written. I particularly liked the way you built suspense and kept the reader guessing until the end.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved. First, I would recommend being more concise in your writing. For example, the sentence "At some point during 2027-no one knows for sure-bakers began replacing items across the country" could be shortened to "At some point during 2027, bakers began replacing items across the country."

In addition, I would recommend using more active and precise verbs. For example, instead of saying "The day the story came out, the day it was revealed our president was made of cake, was the day all hell broke loose," you could say "The day the story came out, revealing our president was made of cake, all hell broke loose."

Overall, this is a well-written and suspenseful story. With a few minor revisions, it could be even better.
