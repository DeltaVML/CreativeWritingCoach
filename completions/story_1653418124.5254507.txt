================================

You have a beautiful writing style, and your descriptions are evocative and lyrical. However, there are a few areas where your story could be improved.

First, your dialogue feels a little stilted and unnatural. You may want to consider revise it to make it sound more natural.

Second, your story feels a little slow in places. You may want to consider picking up the pace in some areas, or adding some action to keep the reader engaged.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. I encourage you to keep writing and refining your craft.
