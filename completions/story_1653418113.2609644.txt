================================

The story was well-written and engaging. I particularly liked the way it ended, with the sugar grain landing on the leaf.

However, there were a few things I noticed that could be improved. First, there were a few typos, such as "towards it, wanting see a butterfly up close for the first time." These typos can be easily fixed with a spell checker or by reading the story aloud.

Second, there were a few awkward phrases, such as "The flap of its wings was seen by a child." This could be rewritten as "The child saw the butterfly's wings flapping."

Third, the story could be further improved by adding more description, such as the color of the butterfly or the child's reaction to seeing it.

Overall, the story was enjoyable and well-written. With a few minor tweaks, it could be even better.
