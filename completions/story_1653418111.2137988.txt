Starting with a compliment, I really enjoyed the short story and the plot line. The idea of the boyfriend being a famous actor and the protagonist not knowing was a really interesting twist. I also liked how the story was set up, with the exposition at the beginning and then the climax at the end.

Constructive criticism wise, I would work on developing the characters a bit more. As it stands, the reader doesn't really know much about the protagonist or the boyfriend. What are their hobbies? What do they like to do for fun? What are their hopes and dreams? Answering these questions will help the reader connect with the characters more and make them more three-dimensional.

Ending with another compliment, I thought the ending of the story was really well done. It wrapped up the plot nicely and left the reader with a feeling of satisfaction.
