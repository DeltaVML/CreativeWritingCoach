The story opens with a strong image of the piles of icing on the floor, and the ball of cake in the protagonist's hand. This immediately sets the tone for the story, and gives the reader a sense of foreboding.

However, the following sentence feels out of place and interrupts the flow of the story: *That cake used to be a chunk of my wife's arm.* This sentence is unnecessary and could be removed without affecting the story.

The story then goes on to describe the 'Cakedemic' in detail. This is well done, as it gives the reader a clear idea of the situation.

The protagonist's reaction to the 'Cakedemic' is also well done. The scene where he stabs random things in his house is particularly effective in conveying his desperation.

However, the ending of the story is somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying. The reader is left with more questions than answers, and the story ends on a note of confusion and horror.
