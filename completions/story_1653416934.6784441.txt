The first paragraph of your story is very well written and sets up the scene nicely. I especially like the detail about the WhatsApp group and the email. However, the second paragraph feels a bit rushed and could be fleshed out more. For example, you could describe Morgana's appearance in more detail and how the protagonist is feeling.

The third paragraph is well written and furthers the plot. I like the detail about the clock striking 9am sharp. However, the fourth paragraph feels a bit contrived and could be rewritten to flow better. For example, you could describe the protagonist's reaction to the food and copies in more detail.

The fifth paragraph is well written and furthers the plot. I like the detail about Morgana's smirk. However, the sixth paragraph feels a bit rushed and could be fleshed out more. For example, you could describe the protagonist's reaction to the contract in more detail.

In general, I think your story is well written and has potential. I would recommend fleshing out the scenes and descriptions more to create a more immersive and engaging experience for the reader.
