================================

The dialogue in this piece is well done and natural sounding. I like the way the conversation between the two women is used to contrast with the protagonist's internal monologue. However, there are a few clunky phrases, such as "going postal" and "Uber-hell" which jar the reader out of the immersion in the story.

The description of the DMV is well done and vividly conveys the protagonist's feelings of frustration and anger. However, the description of the fallen angel is a bit heavy-handed and could be toned down.

Overall, this is a well-written piece with engaging dialogue and vivid description.
