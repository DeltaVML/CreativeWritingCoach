================================

The beginning of your story is very strong, you set the scene well and introduce the conflict immediately. I like the detail you include about the vinyl discs stuck to the walls, it helps create a vivid picture. However, I feel like the rest of the story falls flat.

The dialogue in the second paragraph is stilted and unnatural. It sounds like you are trying too hard to be clever. Additionally, the explanation of the protagonist's power is very heavy-handed and expositionary.

The third paragraph is better, but the dialogue still sounds forced. The climax of the story is also very anti-climactic. We don't get a sense of the protagonist's triumph, only of the villain's demise.

Overall, this story needs more development. The concept is interesting, but it is not executed well. With more work, this could be a really great story.
