================================

The opening of your story is very strong. You immediately set the scene and introduce the conflict. I like the detail about the werewolves and the protagonist's injuries. However, the dream sequence that follows feels out of place and disrupts the flow of the story. It would be better to either cut it out entirely, or move it to the end of the story as a sort of twist ending.

The rest of the story is well-written and engaging. I like the use of the song lyrics as the protagonist's internal monologue. The ending is also very satisfying. Overall, this is a very strong piece of writing. Well done!
