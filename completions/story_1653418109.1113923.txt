The opening paragraph of your story is very strong. You immediately set up a contrast between the engineering and science of the modern world and the power of music. You also establish a clear thesis - that music has the power to connect us to generations past and to our common humanity. This is a great start to your story.

However, the second paragraph feels a bit choppy and could be revised for clarity. You introduced the idea that music has real, metaphysical power - which is intriguing - but then you jump into examples of this power without sufficient explanation. It might be helpful to provide a bit more context for the reader before giving specific examples.

The third paragraph is much better in this regard. You provide clear examples of how you have used your musical powers to help others. This is much easier for the reader to follow.

You have a strong voice and an interesting premise for your story. I think with a bit of fine-tuning, it could be even stronger.
