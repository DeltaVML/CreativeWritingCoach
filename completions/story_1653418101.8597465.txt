Your story has a unique premise and is full of potential. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. First, your sentence structure is often choppy and awkward. Try to vary your sentence lengths and use more transitional phrases to flow more smoothly. Second, your descriptions could be more vivid. For example, when you describe the different smells, try to be more specific and use more concrete images. Finally, your ending feels a bit abrupt and could use more development. Overall, there is potential here, but it needs to be polished more.
