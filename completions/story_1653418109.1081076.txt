Your story has potential, but there are some areas that could use improvement. For one, your sentences are often choppy and could be combined to create smoother, more flowing prose. Additionally, your dialogue could be more natural and less on-the-nose. In other words, your characters should sound like real people talking, rather than robots reciting lines.

One area where you did well was in your descriptions. Your readers can easily visualize the scene and the actions taking place. This is an important skill for a writer to have, so keep up the good work!
