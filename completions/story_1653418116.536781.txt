Your story has potential, but there are a few things you can do to improve your writing.

First, watch your word choice. "Masticating" is not a word most people would use to describe someone eating a banana. You want to use words that are easy for your reader to understand.

Second, make sure your story is clear. In the beginning, it's not clear why Julia is talking to the wall. Is she crazy? Is the wall actually talking to her? It's not until later that we learn she's just talking to herself.

Finally, watch your pacing. The story feels a bit slow in the beginning. You may want to consider starting with the rabbit at the door, rather than starting with Julia eating cereal.

Overall, there is potential in your story. with a few tweaks, it could be really good.
