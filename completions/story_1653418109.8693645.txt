================================

The first thing I noticed in your story was the use of dialogue to move the plot along. I thought this was a nice touch and it helped to keep the reader engaged. However, there were a few places where the dialogue felt a bit forced and unnatural. I would suggest reading your dialogue aloud to see if it sounds natural when spoken. If it doesn't, try rewriting it to sound more natural.

I also noticed that you used a lot of description to set the scene. This is generally a good thing, but in some places it felt a bit overdone. Try to be more concise in your descriptions and focus on the most important details.

Overall, I thought this was a well-written story. Keep up the good work!
