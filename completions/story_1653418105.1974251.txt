The opening sentence is good, it immediately establishes the tone and voice of the story. The dialogue between the two characters is well done and believable. However, there are a few areas where the story could be improved:

- There is a lot of exposition in the dialogue, which slows down the pacing of the story. Try to find ways to show the information instead of telling it.
- The ending feels abrupt and unfinished. Make sure to wrap up the story so that readers are satisfied.
- There are a few typos and grammatical errors throughout the story. Be sure to proofread your work before submitting it.
