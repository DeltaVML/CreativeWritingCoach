The first thing I noticed in your story is that you have a lot of interesting ideas, and you certainly have a unique writing style. That being said, there are a few areas where I think you could improve.

First, I would recommend being more concise in your writing. There are a few places where you could cut out unnecessary words or phrases. For example, in the second paragraph, you could cut out the phrase "one of Yahweh's silly little inclusions in the sim." This doesn't really add anything to the story, and it interrupts the flow of the sentence.

Second, I would recommend being more specific in your descriptions. In the third paragraph, you describe the Julia creature as "mostly hairless and covered in a tight neoprene covering." This is a bit vague and could be more specific. For example, you could say "The Julia creature was mostly hairless, with a few patches of fur on its body. It was wearing a tight neoprene covering."

Overall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer. I really enjoyed reading your story, and I'm looking forward to reading more of your work in the future.
