First, I want to commend you for using descriptive language to set the scene and create a sense of place. I also like the way you use sensory details to engage the reader's imagination. However, there are a few things you could do to improve the flow and clarity of your writing. For example, you might want to break the story up into shorter paragraphs to make it easier to read. You might also want to clarify the relationship between It That Slumbers and Daisy. Are they friends? Family? What is the nature of their relationship?

Overall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer. I hope you will continue to work on your craft and I look forward to reading more of your work in the future.
