You have a lot of potential as a writer. You have a great imagination, and you clearly have a love for language. However, there are a few areas where you could use some improvement.

First, you need to work on your sentence structure. Your sentences are often choppy and awkward. This makes your writing difficult to read. You also need to work on your grammar. There are a number of errors in your story.

Second, you need to work on your description. Your description is often either too vague or too dense. You need to find a balance. You also need to be more consistent with your description. In some parts of your story, you describe your characters and setting in great detail. In other parts, you barely describe anything at all.

Third, you need to work on your dialogue. Your dialogue is often stiff and unnatural. You need to make it sound more like how people actually speak.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. I think with some practice, you could become a very good writer.
