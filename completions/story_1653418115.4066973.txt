================================

Your story is well-written and engaging. I particularly liked the banter between the two cellmates. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, you have a lot of dialogue in your story. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, too much dialogue can make a story feel choppy. You may want to consider breaking up some of the dialogue with action or description.

Second, you have several typos in your story. While typos are not necessarily a deal-breaker, they can be distracting for readers. I would recommend proofreading your story before submitting it for publication.

Overall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. I encourage you to keep writing and to seek feedback from other writers.
