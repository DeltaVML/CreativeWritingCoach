================================

The opening of this story is very effective in setting the tone and mood. The description of the boy is disgusting and immediately sets a tone of unease. The use of sensory detail is very good, and I particularly like the way the forest is described as being predatory.

However, there are some issues with sentence structure and word choice. For example, "In his hand was a sticky lollipop, strands of hair both human and animal, and tufts of fabric stuck to it." This sentence is confusing and could be rewritten more clearly. Additionally, "The sound was almost like the giant tongue was salivating, the forestâ€™s predatory, hungry gaze savoring the thought of swallowing him up with a dry, throaty gulp." This sentence is clunky and could be rewritten more concisely.

Overall, this is a well-written and atmospheric piece. With some minor corrections, it could be even stronger.
