================================

You have a very interesting and unique writing style, and I enjoy reading your work. However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, your grammar could use some work. I would recommend reading your work aloud to yourself or having someone else read it aloud to you to help catch errors. Second, your story is a bit confusing in parts. I would recommend being more clear in your writing, and making sure that each sentence flows smoothly into the next. Finally, I think you could add more description to your work to help paint a clearer picture for the reader. Overall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer and I look forward to reading more of your work in the future.
