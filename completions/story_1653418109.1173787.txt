================================

The opening of this story is very strong, with great sensory detail that really sets the scene and gets the reader immersed in the action. I particularly like the image of the protagonist's helmet being torn off. However, there are a few small grammatical errors, such as "I couldn't come close to dodging the follow-up swing, catching me square in the nose and... that's the last thing I remember." which could be easily corrected.

The story loses some momentum in the middle, when the focus shifts to the recovery team. This section feels somewhat abrupt and out of place, and could be rewritten to better fit with the rest of the story.

Overall, this is a strong story with a great opening and good sensory detail. With a few small tweaks, it could be even better.
