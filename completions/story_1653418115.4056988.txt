================================

Your story is well-written and engaging. I particularly liked the way you built suspense and tension throughout. However, there are a few areas where you could improve.

First, I would recommend being more specific in your descriptions. For example, when you describe the protagonist's ancestor watching the mass murderer, you could be more specific about what she saw and how it made her feel.

Second, I would recommend using more active verbs. For example, instead of saying "He was acquitted due to overwhelming witness testimony," you could say "The jury acquitted him due to the overwhelming witness testimony."

Overall, this is a well-written and suspenseful story. Keep up the good work!
