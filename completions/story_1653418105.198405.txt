Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, your dialogue could be more natural and flowing. It sounds a bit stilted and stiff in places. Second, your characters need to be more developed. We don't really know anything about them other than their basic conflict. What motivates them? Why do they act the way they do? Finally, the ending of the story feels abrupt and unfinished. What happened to the main character after the incident with the Kanuut?

Overall, there is a lot of potential in this story, but it needs some work in order to reach its full potential. Keep up the good work!
