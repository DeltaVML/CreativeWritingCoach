================================

The opening line of your story is very strong. It immediately grabs the reader's attention and sets up a sense of foreboding. I really like the way you use simple, declarative sentences to deliver your message. However, I think you could be more concise in some places. For example, the second paragraph could be shortened to:

"But destruction is easier than creation. I cannot yet save this world, but I can destroy it. Any successful AI project can destroy this world."

I think this would be more impactful and would keep the reader's attention more focused on the story.

In general, I think your story is well-written and has a strong message. I think you could tighten up the language in some places to make it even more powerful. But overall, I think you did a great job!
