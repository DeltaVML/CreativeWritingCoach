Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement. First, your dialogue sounds a bit stiff and unnatural. You might want to try reading it aloud to see how it sounds, and make sure that the characters are speaking in their own unique voices. Additionally, your story could use a bit more description to help set the scene and create a more immersive experience for the reader. Don't be afraid to use a few more adjectives and adverbs to help paint a picture in the reader's mind.

Overall, I think you have a lot of great ideas in this story, and with a bit of fine-tuning, it could be really great. Keep up the good work!
