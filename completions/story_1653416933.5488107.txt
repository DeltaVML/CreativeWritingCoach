The beginning of your story is intriguing, and I like the idea of the AI character Jim. However, I felt that the dialogue was choppy and difficult to follow in places. I suggest reading it aloud to yourself or to a friend to see how it flows. I also suggest using shorter, simpler sentences to make it easier for the reader to follow.

In addition, I felt that the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. I suggest expanding on Jim's answer and on the reaction of the expedition members. What does Jim's answer mean for the future of humanity? What will the expedition members do next? I also suggest ending with a more powerful image or statement.
