================================

The opening paragraph is confusing and difficult to follow. You might want to consider revising it to make it more understandable. For example, you could explain why the protagonist is on Venus, and why they are confused by the humans.

The second paragraph provides helpful background information about the world, but it is dense and could be trimmed down.

The third paragraph is well-written and evocative. The description of the storm is particularly effective.

The final paragraph is a good way to end the story, with the protagonist's unanswered question providing a sense of mystery.
