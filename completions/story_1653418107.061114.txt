Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some work. First, your dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. Make sure that your characters are speaking in a way that sounds natural and realistic. Also, watch your pacing. Your story feels a bit slow in places and could use some tightening up.

Overall, I think you have a lot of interesting things going on in your story and I enjoyed reading it. Keep up the good work!
