First, I will give you a compliment, then I will provide critical feedback, then I will give you another compliment.

Your story has a strong hook and a unique premise. I was immediately engaged and curious to see where the story would go. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

First, the dialogue could be more realistic. It feels a bit stilted and forced in places. Second, the story could be more concise. There are a few areas that feel unnecessary or could be shortened.

Overall, this is a strong story with a lot of potential. Keep up the good work!
