================================

The opening of this story is very strong, I love the use of imagery and the descriptions of the forest and the character's injuries. However, the story starts to lose steam in the middle. The dialogue is choppy and the exposition is heavy-handed. The story ends on a strong note, but the middle section needs work.

You have a lot of great ideas in this story, and your descriptions are evocative. I suggest you work on streamlining the middle section, and focus on making the dialogue more natural. You have a lot of potential as a writer, and I think with some practice you could produce some really great work.
