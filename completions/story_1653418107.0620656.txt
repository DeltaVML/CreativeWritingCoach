The beginning of your story is very strong. You set the scene well and introduce the reader to the conflict immediately. I like the way you use dialogue to further the conflict and introduce the reader to the characters. However, the middle of the story feels a bit rushed. You introduce the idea of the ultimate power and the sword's quest for blood, but it feels like this could be developed further.

The end of the story is also strong. You bring the conflict to a conclusion and leave the reader with a thought-provoking question. Overall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer. I would encourage you to develop your ideas further and to focus on your descriptions and imagery.
