================================

1. Your story has an interesting premise, and I like the way you explore religious themes.

2. However, I found the prose to be somewhat dense and difficult to follow in places. I would recommend streamlining your language and sentence structure to make your story more accessible to readers.

3. I also felt that the ending was a bit abrupt and unsatisfying. You may want to consider expanding on the climax of the story and tying up loose ends more neatly.
