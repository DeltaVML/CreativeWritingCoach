Your story has an interesting premise, and I like the idea of a vampire trying to recruit a human. However, there are a few things you can do to improve your prose. First, watch your grammar and punctuation. There are a few errors in your story that can be easily corrected. Second, try to add more description to your story. Describe the setting, the characters, and the action in more detail. This will help your readers to visualize what is happening in the story. Finally, try to vary your sentence structure. Using a variety of sentence lengths will make your story more interesting to read.
