================================

The story started off well, with the diplomats discussing their mission. However, it began to feel a bit choppy and rushed once they arrived at their destination. The description of the manor was well done, but it felt like there was something missing from the story. Perhaps more development on the characters or the situation would have helped. Overall, it was an interesting story, but it could have been better.
