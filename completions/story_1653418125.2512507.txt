================================

The opening sentence of your story is intriguing and really made me want to read on. However, I felt that the rest of the story did not live up to the promise of the opening line. In particular, I felt that the story was very rushed and could have benefited from slowing down the pace a bit.

Additionally, I felt that the story was quite simplistic and could have benefited from more development, both in terms of plot and characters. In particular, I would have liked to see more of the protagonist's internal conflict and struggle with the implications of the lottery win.

Overall, I felt that the story had potential but needed more development in order to truly shine.
