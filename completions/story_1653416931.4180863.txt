First, I want to commend you for your use of sensory detail and concrete images. Your descriptions really brought the scene to life for the reader. I also liked the way you used numbers to create a sense of tension and foreboding.

However, I felt that the story was a bit choppy in places and could use some more connective tissue to help the reader follow the thread of the story. In addition, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt and could use some more development.
